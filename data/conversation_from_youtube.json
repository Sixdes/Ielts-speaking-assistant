You'd be on the brink of an 8.5 or a maximum of 9. So that's really, really excellent. You spoke wonderfully throughout this, and I think lots of students will take away some of the things that you've said and they'll be able to learn from it. So thank you for your time, Alicia today, thank you so much. Hello and welcome to this mock exam session. I'm so happy to have you back. Today. We have the wonderful student Alicia, She's from Singapore, and she has a couple of areas where she could improve. I also want to think about, what you would do if you had an examiner who was really friendly or if you had an examiner who was a little bit more serious. Maybe they didn't give you anything back in terms of body language. We hear from students all the time that some examiners are really friendly and some examiners are a little bit miserable. They don't, smile, they don't give you anything back, so be prepared for both. Are you ready to begin this video? Come on, let's go. Hello and welcome to this mock exam session.

Now for some of you that's really surprising because in your country maybe your examiner is quite serious. Maybe they don't have any emotions on their face, it really depends on the examiner and it depends on the day. So if you have a friendly examiner like Maddie, that's normal. Also, if you have a serious examiner, don't be put off. Just keep talking as though you're talking to a friend. So in this case, we have Maddie, she's really friendly, she smiles and she nods along, which is really helpful. It's more like a real conversation. I really wish all examiners did that.

At the beginning of the IELTS test, you will be required to provide some ID, but as this is a practice test, we don't need to do that today. I want to begin by talking about you. Do you work or do you study? I'm currently studying right now I'm studying in the University of Melbourne and I'm majoring in psychology. Do you enjoy what you study? Yes, I do enjoy it, and I've always had like this fascination about psychology and about understanding people and learning about the different theories and how the brain works and how you can apply that to reality and how you can communicate and understand people better. Do you want to study more in the future? Yes I'm actually thinking of doing a Masters. I'm a bit unsure whether I want to go into the business side, so I might study, consumer behaviour. So you learn a about people and how they react to different, different, things in the world. So when you're trying to sell a product, you got to understand the consumers and what they like and what they don't like. So I'm a bit, confused, or I might actually pursue clinical psychology. So doing an honest in, psychology so that I can become a psychologist. "

                "input": "okay? I'm just gonna stop here and talk a little bit about pronunciation. Now clearly Alicia spoke at length, she didn't stop speaking and spoke really, really well, lots of complexity in her grammar. But I want to focus on pronunciation because there's a feature of her pronunciation called the glutal stop. The glutal stop. Now, for those people who know about anatomy and physiology, the epiglottis is the flap, which, moves when you want to speak or if you want to eat and it stops the air and from going into your, lungs and it allows air to go into your lungs, opens and closes. Now in speech there is the gluttal stop and the glutal stop is used really commonly with native speakers. Look at the sentence below and notice how I pronounce it. What time, what time did you notice that I didn't say what time, so what the air continues, what and it finishedes here because you can hear that what what time, but I don't say that I actually say what time and you notice that the air comes up what stops at the epiglottis and does not continue and this is a feature called the grottal stop and Alicia used it a couple of times she said about about instead of about about and it really is a feature that natives native speakers use and in order for you to reach higher levels of pronunciation score in the I ought speaking test, you need to be thinking about these types of techniques they don't come naturally you have to practice and you have to listen to native speakers. It's a really useful feature for you to think about. Look at the sentence below and notice how I pronounce it.

Well, first of all, wanna is not really slang, wanna is just contracted speech. I want to, I wanna, and it is absolutely normal for you to use that during the outspeaking test, you have to speak naturally. So for those people who are a little bit dubious or if you're doubting this really, really, really it's important that you use natural contracted speech. Don't use it in writing, though.

And I've actually been to I've just recently, had a picnic with my friends and, we went to the beach to have the picnic. And I thought it was really fun because, given the circumstances of 2020 with the whole Covid situation, I feel like, the first thing that I want to do is just have quality time with my friends and family after not being able to physically see them. So I thought like having a picnic is a really good, time to actually, talk to people again and reconnect instead of just using your phone or like just, playing video games or watching like Netflix or something. So, so I do enjoy having picnics, especially like when you're outside, you can really just like take it all in and enjoy the sea scenery and it's just a more chill vibe than just, going to a restaurant. And it's more personal for me. "

So after plus I NGI heard after not be able to, but she did have some really good complexity within her grammar. So she said as something like, given the situation of Covid last year, so given is a great way to start a sentence. She probably spoke a little bit more than she needed to, but great, great expansion on her answers. ",

We usually just bring one item each. And so like everyone contributes something to, the picnic, but it depends on like the day as well. Like usually if I would have a picnic, it would be a very sunny day. So definitely cool drinks and, sushi. They are like, cheese platter and dessert as well. "

It's called the subjunctive, the subjunctive and look below it is if I were, if I were to meet the Prime Minister, I would be very humble If I were to wake up late tomorrow, I would be in trouble. So this is an example where the subjunctive, and maybe we'll talk about that in a future video, you can make what would be a grammatical mistake. You can also say if I was, but in this case, she said, if I were, I also heard a few more glossal stops, which were great, we will listen very shortly to Alicia where she may be uses a glutal stop where an a typical native speaker would not.

Yes, I do, I just went last week and we went to San klada Beach to just, have a picnic and afterwards watch the sunset and it was really amazing because like, I thought it was really peaceful. It's been a while since I've been out, given the whole Covid, situation, but ya, it was, it was really amazing to finally see my friends and to finally, enjoy their company and enjoy the food and I would love to have a picnic again soon with my friends or ya, my family.

Can you hear that we went and that's typical many people who are native speakers would use that one another one was picnic picnic, you didn't hear her say picnic, she said picnic and that's another good example of a gostle stop 1, which I'm just a little bit doubtful of, but I did understand it was food, food. If you listen to Alicia, she says food rather than food, can you hear the at the end of food? So just be careful I would say if you are from Singapore just be careful that some of your d sounds are often lost. And I would argue that a typical examiner may, may, may mark you down if they're very strict. New Zealand Australia Canada, America, the United Kingdom, these are all places where English is spoken as a primary first language and therefore they are probably looking for this standardization of pronunciation. We'll hear some more probably little mistakes from Malaysia very soon . ",
                "output": "and are there any problems which could happen during the picnic? Well, yeah, there was a problem that we were facing and that was the seagulls. Like they kept China come and get our food. So that was just one of the like major problems and, the sand as well cause it gets all over as well when the wind blows and everything. But I mean, overall, there was just one of the very few annoying things that, happens. Now I want to talk about music. What sort of music do you enjoy listening to, it really depends on my mood. I would say that I listen to music every day and it really just depends on how I'm feeling. Some days I feel energetic and I would listen to more upbeat music like, pop or EDM electronic dance music. And there are days where like, I listen to indie and slower songs, and there are also days when I listen to rap music. It, it all depends. But ya recently I've been getting I've been getting into a lot more of the indie music and all, But yeah, it just really depends on my mood. And do you find that music helps me study? Yes, I actually listen to music a lot when I'm studying and I think it's very different. It really depends on the person. So, I know one of my friends, they can't listen to music at all and just have to shut everywhere everything out. But I personally have to listen to music. So ya and the music that I listen to, it's, I would see not along or people listen to as well. Like I would listen to actually like EDM music. So a lot of people find it extremely hard to concentrate, but I feel like actually it stimulates my brain more and it gets me more hyped up and happy, happier to actually, continue studying in like motivates me. But ya, I have other friends that listen to music while studying and they tend to listen to classical music, which I understand it actually well, there's a lot of scientific evidence that show that classical music actually helps you like study and get concentrated as well.

Collocation is when you fit two words together, naturally, a great example would be it gets me hyped up, it gets me hyped up to be hyped up means, to gets me energized, the problem that I saw in this particular section of speech is that she repeated the same term a few times, I probably heard it four times and she said it depends on, it depends on my mood, it depends on how I'm feeling, just be careful that you do need to use a variety of different terms and phrases, try not to repeat the same thing again and again.

Cause I didn't grow up listening to a lot of country, but I know that there are people, that enjoy country music that come from the countryside or different countries. They really just focus, like in America, they are quite heavy in certain states that they are quite heavy with country music and, ya, but I grew up in an environment where it was just mostly, what my friends were listening to, which was mostly pop or rap music.

But it really depends if the if the concert was held in a smaller venue and there were and it was more personal and, I would prefer that, but it was held in a stadium, which I have I've been to. It was really chaotic in the sense that I couldn't see anything and I couldn't hear anyone, anybody. Like I couldn't hear like the actual singer, like I went to a Taylor Swift concert. I went to Justin Lever and I could not even hear them like properly because there were just like people around me just screaming constantly. "

And that certificate, certificate for, to me was really important because, it really showed like determination and perseverance as well as hard work really does pay off. So I received this prize, when I was in high school and it was after my major exams. It's IG CSE, so it was like high school exam. And, I received this prize, for being one of the top students in physics and chemistry. And to me, that was really like, for me, I was really happy when I received it because at the start of the school year, I was just not doing well for physics and chemistry. And I was at the brink of fail, failing the subject And actually, ya, so I got about 50 on the dot for the subject just before my major exams. And I thought that I wasn't going to do well, But during the last month, where it was swatt back and we were just studying and just preparing for the exams, I really just put in so much effort to really understanding and learning the concepts. I would spend like the entire day, entire morning and afternoon, just revising and practicing exam questions and, just reading the textbook and just staying back with my tutor to just ask her questions and go through, all the questions that I got wrong. So when I received the prize, like I was really shocked at first because I didn't expect that I would do well in it. And it just made me feel a lot better about myself. And it gave me this drive that if you put your mind to it, you can really s, succeed in the things that you do. There we go. Why do you think you had that extra motivation after you were just hitting bang on 50. I think it was the fear of not doing well and the fear of not getting into a good university. It was the fear of my future and I was, I was afraid that if I didn't do well, it would affect how I how which university I would get in and it would affect, the job that I actually wanted for a long time. I wanted to be a psychologist. I wanted to, to do, I wanted to go into that field. And so I think that was my main motivation and the fear that would fail and not do well and disappoint my parents and myself. So I really wanted to show that, can you really put in the effort? You can do almost anything. "

Yeah, so instead of three, they might say tree and through they would say true. It's not a native feature of pronunciation to say Cher for the T H sound. So I'm just concerned that a really strict examiner would mark her down on pronunciation for this. She also said at the brink of failing, at the brink of failing. Now, I would personally say on the brink of failing, but I think both of them are really great features of language, great lexical resource, less common lexical item.

It's more of, giving that, telling that someone that, you know, you did well. So you're acknowledging the person, the person's contribution and what they did and that can really help, motivate that person to do more and to benefit in the future and help themselves grow as a person ya, and do we give too many prizes nowadays? I would say yes and no. It really depends on what the situation is. I feel like there are times where, there's not a lot of prizes to be won, for example, like, case competition, I feel like it's really competitive and not a lot of people get get acknowledged for the effort that they put in, so I think on that aspect, like there could be more prizes and more acknowledgment for their effort because, I remember I had a friend who entered into the case competition and he just focused on it every single day and he will stay up till early morning to just complete it and he put in a lot of effort, but at the end of the day, it was really hard because like he came in like third, but there was no like acknowledgement for the, for him.

So a lot of the times, personally, I feel that people do cheap because they think that they're not gonna do well and that they're not gonna make it. So that's why they cheat.

I would probably give her a 9 probably, but there are some areas where a really strict examiner would listen and maybe mark her down. Tell us what you think in the comments about this, because in the pronunciation section, it asks you to use a wide variety of features, but you have to use them pretty accurately all the time. And I wonder about the grotto stop. She said things like cold drink and good idea rather than cold and good. You remember the grotto stop, it stops here, cold and good. I just wonder whether a strict examiner may mark her down for that. I also worry that the repetition that she used, it depends, could also be an area where they mark her down. So as a result I'm going to be looking on this. I'm going to be erring on the side of caution. I'm going to be cautious and I'm going to score her 9 for fluentcing coherence. She spoke really well. I'm going to score her 9 for grammatical range and accuracy. She used lots of different features and she was grammatically pretty correct the whole time. Great job. I'm gonna score her 9 for lexical resource because the level of her language was wonderful. She did repeat some ideas a few times, so 9 for that one, but I'm going to go down to an eight for pronunciation because of this glut's stop error. Some of you will say yes, but she spoke most of the time was really understandable. I'm just looking at it from the point of view of a really strict examiner. So overall 9 9 9 8 would be an 8.5 overall, because remember .75 and .25 marks are rounded down. Do we think that's fair? I don't think that's fair, but that's what happens in the IELTS test. So today we talked about how to prepare for an examiner who maybe is a little bit more serious, just talk to them like you're talking to a friend. We also talked about the idea of the glutal stop, try to incorporate the grotto. Stop into some of your speech. Keep practicing and listen to the native speakers on how they use it in their speech too.

And do you see yourself living in a city in the future?

And we'll see a little bit of that later in the video where Talia is looking for a word. Do you find it easy to come up with ideas or do you think find it easy to come up with words?

I do, I do, I used to much more than much more when I was back home just because it was much closer, it was about 10 or 15 minutes away by drive.

She says 10 minutes by drive, you may know that in English, you can't really say by drive, you would have to say by car, you can say on foot, you could say by bus, by car, by train, but we wouldn't normally say by drive. So that would be a little slip In terms of her language, her lexical resource, is it enough to go from a 9 to an 8? I'm not sure. The examiner might be very strict on the day, but I'm looking out for little mistakes like this, which when you add them up, when you have 1, 2, 3, it might bring you down by one band. "

You may want to vary the language a little bit. So for example, you could say you can play, you can tan, you could even.

I'm disgusted by some food, so it makes you go air, it doesn't make you go, which is fear. So I would just question the use of the disgusted by needles.

Discounts are countable, which means that you probably can't say a bit of discounts you she would have to say you can get a few discounts, but the most important thing that I want to cover in this section is language related hesitation. Do you remember earlier there had some content related hesitation in this section? You could see her saying, what's the word? She is struggling to find a word and this is called language related related hesitation in the fluency and coherence section of your mark if we look at the fluency and coherence section, you will see that it says that language related hesitation is not possible and therefore she will probably be stuck at a band 8 in the FC in the fluency and coherence section. She's been doing so well so far, but probably would be stuck at a band 8 for this particular part. "

Here is a paper and a pencil for making note and here is your topic. I would like you to describe a difficult choice you had to make. You have one minute to prepare. Like, hey, ready? Yeah, so remember you have one to two minutes for this, so don't worry if I stop you. I'll tell you when the time is up, okay? Can you start speaking now, please? Sure, so, for the past three years I want to see since I was about 17 years old, my I've wanted to get into veterinary medicine and that's been something that obviously I've researched. I've, I've had to chat to like I've chatted to people about. I did a couple of internships and I found that I really loved it. The issue is that in terms of income, it's so the income isn't very high for veterinarians, especially if you don't have your own clinic. And another issue is that it's highly competitive to get into that school. And so I just had this kind of like hard decision to make. Should I go with it or should I not go with it? And obviously after chatting to some friends, family, and people here at college, I decided that, you know what I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna put my all, if it works out great. If it doesn't work out, I have the plan, a couple extra, you know, plans. And so I decided that it doesn't really matter if it's, if I don't go for it right now, it's gonna be something that is gonna be on my mind forever. Like a, what if kind of, and for me, I hate the feeling of regret. So I'm just gonna, you know, do my best and see if that works up then great. And if not, then that's completely fine. And it's not the end of the world, but at least I know that I did my best and I actually went for it. And luckily I've got the support of my family and friends and, you know, peers at college and university. What else would you do if you couldn't pay of it? So my plan B is that, so I'm applying for a fast track right now. My plan B would be to apply as a graduate, normal graduate entry across the country and to apply for law school so I can get into, animal law and maybe consulting in that area. And then if I don't get into any wet school around the country or law school after undergrad I'll take a year off and then go to Europe or Latin America, teach you some Spanish for a year, and then come back and sauce out some jobs. Great, thank you. Great, thank you. ",

I'm going to go for it, if it works out then great, if it works out is an example of varied grammar complexity, remember for a band 8 or a band 9, you need to be using a wide range of grammatical, sentences, grammatical constructions. So she did really, really well, probably not too much to focus on in her part 2, she was very fluent, she spoke for about a minute and 40, we always recommend if you can speak up to 2 minutes, that's great. However, when I took the test, I didn't speak for two minutes. I said to the examiner that I'm finisheded. And then they asked me another question.

And so how would a government properly, choose where to put this money or where to invest this money? Because they need to take into consideration what's going to benefit the citizens the most and what can also economically benefit them. And I think it's just so many things to take into consideration and to factor in that it's makes it quite difficult.

Now what would you score tallia if you were to be the examiner, would you score her a 9, would you score her an eight or maybe even a 7? Tell us what you think in the comments section section below, tell us what your favorite part of her each was Well, in my view I'm going to talk about the areas that she did the best. So she scored for me a 9 in pronunciation. Her pronunciation was almost flawless throughout, she didn't really make any mistakes, she had lots and lots of natural features of pronunciation, so we talked about chunking, the speech flowed really, really well and she had just really clear enunciation of her words. So she's got a 9 for me, grammatical range and accuracy was also a 9 for me because in her test she has to use lots of grammatical complexity. She had great features of grammar almost, I don't think she had any mistakes, actually I didn't notice any mistakes, so for me, she scores and 9, however Talia, she scored an eight influencing and coherence for me. We spoke today about the importance of hesitation. Do you remember at the beginning she had content related hesitation? Well, later in the test she also had some language related hesitation and as a result she would probably score an eight in her fluencing and coherence and in her lexical resource I'm also going to score her and 8, just a few too many slips and occasional problems with collocations of words. Do you remember some of the things we spoke about? Go back and watch this video if you want to listen to those, features again and have a look and see what you think so overall 8, 8, 9, 9 would be a band 8.5, which is incredibly good. What score do you need? If you have any ideas and if you want to leave your feedback, leave them in the comments. What do you think of tallier's, mock exam? Well, as I said, we have lots more of these mock exams, so make sure you come and watch them, I hope you find them useful, many of them are really great mock exam answers. They have very high band levels, so just make sure that you watch them, learn from them and try to copy some of them. Don't memorize language word for word, but try to look at the features of of their speech. How are they pronouncing words, what type of language are they using, how natural does it does it feel? Because in the test, I want you to be as natural as possible. My name is Chris from ayles Daily and I really hope that you enjoyed this video.

I'm not too sure it depends on my job, it might mean that I go and work overseas, but I really kind of hope to stay in Australia. This is where I was born and this is where I was raised.

Are you a fan of walking? Yes, I love going to the countryside and spending the day walking. Or no? I'm not really a fan of walking. I and tend to enjoy sitting in the garden sometimes. If I'm bored, I might go for a walk with my friend, try to develop the answers because it will give you more opportunities to show grammatical complexity and to really, really give the examiner more meat so that they could mark your, vocabulary, your local resource.

We like to spend time together by going for a walk and taking in the sights of the city, getting some fresh air, All of these pieces of language you could use, you could incorporate into your, speech so that you could show the examiner just how great you are.

No, well I'm not really a person that goes to markets, but I do go to supermarkets. I tend to go twice a week. I tend to drop in to in case I have some groceries that I need to buy. So many things that you could be saying at this point, but I'm just a little bit disappointed, but he's not expanding on his answers very much.

You can buy many things at a market, eh? They tend to be well located or conveniently located in the center of an area. So really try to think of many reasons why people would shop at markets.

So clarity of pronunciation might be, lost a little bit here. He'd probably be marked down at this point. ",
                "output": "But I've seen in more recent times that there's been a upward trend in the markets I've seen advertised. I'm going to give you a topic, and I'd like you to talk about it for one to two minutes before you talk, you'll have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make notes if you wish. Here is a paper and a pencil for making notes, and here is your topic. I would like you to describe a teacher. You remember canal? Okay, thank you. So remember, you have one to two minutes for this, so don't worry if I stop you. I'll tell you when the time is up. Can you start speaking now, please? Worries for my form teacher, we had Mr Bush, he was young about, in his late 20s. I had him for, you know, inform English, Roy at economics, which was actually really good because he was my favorite teacher. So he's, he's always smartly dressed. He's always in boots, wherever you see him, he's not without boots. He's always the shirt and just always had a smile on this festival. So one of the everyone's favorite teacher, I think so relaxes, talks to the students. Every form, we talk about everything. You go around the classroom always talks to every student, to catch up and make sure they're, they're doing well. I was just very charismatic person. And he's done, he's done a bit of, a bit of an unorthodox way of, with his career. So he used to go, it was in marketing before, then he changed crazy because he didn't like it so much. Then he went into teaching. I think it was a bit of a very brave move, and I think it's suited his personality a lot more. Cause it's very good with people. That's one of my favorite things. Before he went into marketing, he, he did rowing professionally, the great rower. I remember just telling us, he just missed out on the Australian Olympic team and then I was really disappointed as well because I would have seen it like plug team achieve great things as we do. Shame they didn't make it. "

And my advice to you, if you can't think of a person, just try to invent somebody. There are so many stories that you could tell about any person, invented or real, it doesn't really matter. The point is, for part two, you have to speak fluently for over one minute and you have to include as many ideas and opinions and feelings as you can. And I just feel that Tom maybe was lacking in expanding his answers. So a bit of, advice for you guys. If you can't think of ideas, just invent something great. ",
                "output": "Well, thank you. Well, now let's talk about education in general. Should all children be required to stay in school until the age of 18? I think so. I think, educations are really important part of life. I think everyone would generally agree with that. My experience with people who have dropped out a bit earlier at the, at the time, they think it's right, they think then they feel that need to be more independent to work to able to support the family early. But oftentimes they will, they will look back and they'll want to, they will regret not finisheding, high school. I think it's having that foundation of high school. I'm not, not just for the education, but for your social standing as well, not social standing, but like social skills, being interact and talk with your peers. I think it's really important. "

                "output": "Is teaching a popular career in your country? I want to say it's the most popular career, but I think it's a little respect to Korea. I think the most popular opinion there is, is that teachers are underpaid for the work because that their work really is invaluable because we really, really do need good teachers for good students for by better generation.

                "output": "Why do people become teachers? I think a lot of times people come teachers to influence the next generation, to give back. I think a lot of them would have had good teachers that would have inspired them. They always want to teach students, students to the best of their abilities. Also. Will technology replace classroom teachers? I really doubt so. There there have been online education programs such as Ed a Roller, and I feel like even though they can supplement, practical or in person teaching, they definitely can substitute them.

                "input": "Wonderful, thanks Tom and thanks Maddie. I want to look at the band descriptors today and think about how Tom would have scored if he had taken the real test. Let's have a band look at the band descriptors on the screen now, and you will see that, for the fluency and coherence you, did he meet a band 9 speaks fluently with only rare repetition or self correction? Yes, but he didn't have to repeat himself, He used a variety of different words. Any hesitation is content related rather than define words or grammar. Yes, speaks coherently with fully appropriate, cohesive features, coherently understandable, Yes, develops topics fluently and appropriately. I think this is the area that we would mark Tom down. I don't think that he develops topics, fully, I think he could have spoken a lot more And so therefore I would award Tom a band 8 in the fluency and coherence section. The next section is lexical resource. It says for a band 9, he uses vocabulary with full flexibility and precision in all topics. He uses idiomatic language naturally and accurately. I would probably say that a generous examiner would give Tom a 9 in this section, he did have lots of idiomatic features. He had less common words, and he did use the language flexibly. Grammatical change and accuracy. I would say that he would score a band 9 here, two, he uses a full range of structures naturally and appropriately, and he produces consistently accurate structures apart from slips. So yes, he didn't have any major problems here. The final category is pronunciation. And this we've spoken about during the test. He did make some mumbled sentences. He gave us a few sentences where I didn't quite catch what he would try, what he was trying to say. And therefore, for a band 8, it says is easy to understand. Throughout L 1, accent has minimal effect and intelligibility so. It was not effortless to understand. There were a couple of month moments where I had to strain and I still couldn't quite understand what he was wanting to say. So overall, 8, 9, 9 8 would be an overall band score of 8.5. And this is an example where a native speaker could just be a little bit more prepared to speak as fluently and as clearly as possible. And many native speakers come out of the test with a band 8 or a band 8.5 because they were just a little bit underprepared. Well done to Tom. Anyway, he did a great job, and I hope you guys learned something about this in the test, how to, evaluate using the band descriptors. They're an incredibly important set of, marking criteria that you should be aware of. You should download those band descriptors. You can find them anywhere on the internet. You can see below, it's just the IELTS speaking band descriptors, you can Google those or put them in a search engine and find them very easily.

So describe a TV documentary with your watch that you enjoyed. The last 1 I watched it was about, the most country, the population in this country who lived the longer than the other countries, why I watch this documentary because when I have kids back to the kids when I had the first baby, I decided to change my lifestyle to stop eating bad food, to stop eating junk food, to change everything. So when I saw this documentary, I felt like I have, it's a must, I have to watch this documentary and to see why this population or this country, they live longer than the other countries and mainly it's, it was like because of the food, the organic food, they don't go to the gym, but they walk a lot. They don't set like doing nothing. No, they are always active. So, I learned a lot while watching the documentary because my husband used to make fun of me. Okay, why you are using buckwheat flour instead of the normal flower when I watch this documentary I've got the answer. And I told him, look when when you eat this flour instead of this, it will help you, it will help your blood not to, how to say it to absorb the sugar. So this is the difference between this and this. That's why in Italy if you realize that the food is based on carbs, why they are not fat or why they are not like, sumo because, of the good, ingredients they use and the quality of food they have.

One thing that you did particularly well was you really developed your answers. And you were very fluent, so you had no problem talking about those things. One thing that you do that could become a problem, I don't think it is a problem, is that you tend to answer the question and then you will go off and speak about things related to that question, but kind of adjacent to that topic, you know, so you're going off and talking about your children related to that rather than really sticking to the question. So you get a mark for it's called coherence, which means did you answer the question and really develop the answer related to that question? So you didn't do it that much, but sometimes you went off and talked about about things, which is okay, but we wanna help you get the highest mark mark possible. With part two, you had no problem speaking for two minutes. Most students find it very difficult to speak for two minutes. You don't have any problem at all speaking for two minutes about that, just be careful and again, you stick to the topic. It was described a TV documentary and you talked a lot about you and your husband and his health and why that food is healthy. That's okay to cause it's related to that topic. So in the way that you didn't was probably fine, but the question is describe a documentary, so you should really, really focus on that. The only weakness that you have is really sticking to and answering the actual question, okay? So you can use examples from your own life. You know, for example, my husband, we started using buckwheat in the pasta and that really helped him. And then go back to the documentary. If you did the test for real, you might be under pressure, you might be stressed out, And when people are stressed out, they're not thinking clearly. And then you might start talking about things that are not really related to the question part 3, you did develop your answers, but you should try to maybe use a little bit more development, use things like explaining why you think that or giving examples will help you develop it a little bit more. Again, sometimes you kind of went off on a tangent, a good way to think about the questions is maybe for EV, for most of these part 3 questions, there's a not all of them, but most of them, there's like most things, this side and this side. Alright, so if you want to think more clearly about these questions, it would be, well, some people think this. Here's why they think that. Some people think this, here's why they think that I personally believe this. So for example, how important are regulations on TV? So some people think that there shouldn't be any regulations, maybe because they're advertisers and they want to sell more stuff, other people think that they should be heavily regulated. Because of children, you know, children should not be exposed to certain things through advertising. Personally I'm a parent, so I think that there should be regulations especially, before 9 p nowadays. Some people think this, here's why they think that I personally believe this.

            {
                "input": "Yeah, so you can see how I give a more indepth, more balanced view, especially the last question. It was kind of like you were talking as you were thinking. It's better to take a few seconds and think, you know, you don't have to immediately give an answer. Yeah, but think, okay, why do people think this? Why do people think that? And then you can, you can give the answer so that that that would help things, but overall excellent. Like really, really, really, really well done. So let me give you some feedback on pronunciation, fluency, grammar, and vocab. Larry, for pronunciation, the examiner will be thinking, can I understand everything that she says and they will, he or she listening to you will be able to understand 100 percent of what you're saying. So you'll get a very high mark for pronunciation. You do have a Lebanese accent and that should be, you should be very proud of that. A lot of people think that getting a high mark for pronunciation means sounding British or American or Australian. That's not what it's about at all. And some of the best students in the world have very strong accents, but it's not about speaking with a British accent. It's about using your own accent to, speak as clearly as possible. And you do an excellent job with that. So you would get a very high, high score, for your pronunciation. It's very, very good, yes, and you also use intonation very well. So your voice going up, your voice going down, yeah, to show meaning, you do that very well. So overall your pronunciation is, is the very, very.

            {
                "input": "exactly and as I said I'm sitting with you talking and there's not one word that I don't understand. So yeah, it's very, very good move on to fluency and coherence. So fluency and coherence is 1, 1 band fluency means speaking normally without pausing or hesitating or repetition, you have no problem with that in general, but we'll we'll come back to that in a second coherence is your main issue. So coherence is, did you answer the question? So sometimes you go off on a, you remind me of my sister, my sister can speak for days and she you ask her about one thing and she ends . ",
                "output": "up talking about you, you're right because I forgot that we have the time and I'm like. "

            },
            {
                "input": "So it's not a criticism, it's just, but remember they're they're testing that so you would maybe get a lower mark for appearance. And then fluency, especially towards the end cause you were trying to think of the correct answer. It's a speaking test, so there's no correct answer. Any answer is, is acceptable. They're not testing your, your knowledge of the, of the topic or your, IQ, they're just using these general topics. Yeah, so that anyone can talk about them. That's why they ask you about questions that anyone in Lebanon or Vietnam or South Africa or any country in the world will know about these topics. So you don't have to be an expert in them. In part 3, if you get a difficult topic, feel free to say, I don't know much about this, but here's my guess. Yeah, you know, and throw, throw out that just keep talking and that and that's absolutely fine. And then at the end you can, you didn't know the right word because that sometimes happens even, you know, even myself when I'm speaking I'm like, my mind is gone blank.

            {
                "input": "what is the yeah exactly if that happens in the in the test, all you have to do is say to the examiner, I'm thinking of this word. I can't think of the exact one, but it means this or paraphrase it that that this and that, that's absolutely fine. Cause that happens in normal like when you're speaking Arabic, when I'm speaking English, I do it when I'm teaching all the time. Cause they're, they're not looking for the perfect answer They're looking for if you move to London or Canada or New York City and you got a job in one of those in a company there, would you be able to communicate with those people? Absolutely, yeah, you know, and that's what really they're testing for grammar, your grammar is excellent. I very, very good, very, very accurate. You do make certain little slips like this one, for example, but these are just little slips. You're not making them all the time time. Alright, so 90% of your sentences have no errors in them, no grammatical errors. You do make little slips, but none of those slips stop me understanding what you're saying. So if you were making grammar mistakes where I'm like, what? What does she mean? Like, I don't know what she mean, then that would be an issue. But because your slips are minor and not frequent at all, you would get a very high score for grammar. So your grammar is very, very good. The same with your vocabulary, your vocabulary is of a very high standard such as this. So you can see that you use very good topic specific vocabulary and also very idiomatic, vocabulary. So this is vocabulary that native English speakers would use that learner generally learners wouldn't be able to use. So that demonstrates that you've got a very high level of vocabulary. So okay, overall you would get a high score, except for coherence, influency that's what you should work on. And we'd like to invite invite you back. And we can do another one and we can see if you get the top score. Thank you, thank you. The same with your vocabulary, your vocabulary is of a very high standard such as this.

We're very happy to see her again and she has some different questions and I want to talk about confidence today. One of the most important things when you're sitting the test is to feel confident about the way you're speaking, ilest is about speaking naturally. You don't have to show off or try to speak with really high level words, your language, and this is from the band descriptors, needs to be natural with some less common words, idiomatic words. But for the most part, you just have to give reasons for your answers, speak fluently without stopping, and try to vary your language as much as possible.

I want to begin by talking about you Do you have a large family? I don't actually. It's just myself and my brother, so it's very tight knit. And how often do you speak to your family? Every day, I make sure to call my parents, both my mom and my dad, at least once a day, and my brother and I are very close, so I'm actually going over to see him after this. Because of the distance, I make it a point to, you know, call them every day. So we don't feel such a large gap. "

I do, yes, because in Sri Lanka where I grew up, you don't actually drink water from the tap, you can't, you will get sick. But yeah, so I do drink quite a bit of bottled water now I want to talk about the sky, do you like to look at the sky? I do It's very peaceful and just calming to look at the sky. Do you prefer to look at the sky during the day or the night if you're not in the city? I think the night sky is stunning because you don't have the light pollution, so you just see a lot of stars and it's just beautiful. But if you are in the city, I can see why. The sky during the day is a lot more pleasing. "

When she gives the answer, she probably could elaborate a little bit more. So we talked about drinking bottled water, and she just said, yes, I do. And then she kind of felt the need afterwards to explain a little bit more. She didn't push herself quite as much, but then she spoke at length about the next topic.

Good job. ",
                "output": "great. I'm going to give you a topic and I'd like you to talk about it for one to two minutes before you talk, you'll have one minute to think about what you're going to say and you can make notes if you wish. Here is a paper and pencil for making notes. Thank you. And here is your topic. I would like you to describe an older person who has inspired you. Okay, so remember you have one to two minutes for this, so don't worry if I stop you. I'll tell you when the time is up. Can you start speaking now, please? So an older person who has inspired me would be my mother. She is well, I know her because she is my mother and I don't see her very often because we live so far apart. But I make it a point to call her everyday, communicate, and literally if I'm doing something, she'll be on the phone there with me and I'm just talking like I'm just wasting time, but I am just talking. And the reason I find her so inspiring would be because she didn't finished, like she didn't go to university. She started, she got dragged into like, she got a modeling job, started that. And from that point on, she has gone on to, she is a director of finance at my parents' companies and she built buildings for like, she built the office buildings herself, she built a house herself and she didn't have the educational background that so many people think is necessary. Sorry for you to do so many things with your life, but she has done everything, and she's one of the most intelligent people that you would ever meet, like you can have a conversation with her. And you'd think that she was the most learned scholar, but really, she just has an opinion and she just goes with it. And she'll make sure she knows. She makes sure that she knows, you know, that her opinion exists and it's valid. And yeah. So that's why I find her so inspiring. It's just that she never let anything stop her when she grew up. She grew up in the height of the war back home in Sri Lanka, and she still didn't let that inhibit her getting an education or getting places in life. She always made sure that regardless of what happened, she and her family were well looked after. She was a working mom, but she always made sure that by the time 3 o'clock came and my brother and I were out of school, she was hands on, she would drive us to classes, take us back swimming, practice drama classes, this, that, and the other. She was very, very involved, which with a working mommy, you don't always expect, right? Thank you. "

Great, she elaborated on her answers, she gave her opinions, her thoughts explained about who the person was, who inspired her, gave details. She did look down at the card a couple of times, but that's normal. She looks for some prompts from the card, no major mistakes, great features of language, fantastic pronunciation, really top quality job. ",
                "output": "Now let's talk about older people generally who normally looks after older people in your country. Well, the family back home as much as possible. You wouldn't put anybody older into a home. You look after them yourself. You look after your parents yourself, because we have the idea that my mother looked after me. It's my turn to look after her. That's that's the sort of mentality, but I think now with the with migration becoming so big, you have a lot more people who put their parents in homes and then just just migrate to other countries like Australia, the UK, wherever else. But for the most part, we look after our parents and our older people. Does the government provide good social care for elderly people where you live? Not really because we are a developing country and because of that, I feel they don't actually take the time to make the space. And this sort of like, I don't know how best to explain this because it's such a complicated and dynamic thing because there's so much political involvement with the social lives of people. But somehow it's not always for the best. "

So this would be a completely normal thing to do, start talking a little bit about something and she's looking for ideas. This is content related hesitation, and we've spoken about that in a previous video. And then she realizes she has her answer and starts talking more totally normal to do that. ",

Remember that part 3 questions are always quite difficult. She didn't really give a reason for, whether the government really supports elderly people. She kind of skirted around the topic, but did give somewhat of a vague answer. And that's okay. There's no right or wrong answer in iolts you just have to be able to speak fluently, which she did. ",
                "output": "How can society ensure that older people are not neglected? I think it comes with teaching the younger generations to respect their elders because neglect, it's something that, you know, if you, if you see your parents neglected their parents, you're more likely to neglect your own. Does that make sense? And if you teach young kids that this is how you are supposed to care for somebody, regardless of how old they are or how valuable they are to you in your society, I think then you'd make sure that, you know, there's less neglect going on of older people, right? Thank you very much. That is the end of the speaking test. "

What did you think of Saskia, in her speech, I was really thoroughly impressed. She speaks so well, so confidently. And remember, we talked about confidence today. She answers really naturally. Sometimes you'll find her looking up, looking for ideas, but that's completely normal. Remember, on the test day, you're gonna be nervous and you're gonna be facing the examiner that maybe doesn't give you any emotions back, so don't be put off by that. Try to just speak as naturally and as honestly as possible. I was really impressed. And I think a typical examiner in this particular case would score 9 for fluency and coherence. She spoke at length 9 for lexical resource, 9 for grammatical range and accuracy, and 9 for pronunciation. Sh. This was an example of an excellent band 9 speaking answer, so well done to Saskia, if you watched her previous video, she did make a small, a pronunciation mistake and lots of people said, how can the examiner be so strict in pronunciation? Well, that that's just how the test works I'm afraid, so be prepared for a really strict examiner today. Saskia did fantastically well, so good job to her. If you like these videos, please share them with your friends. Come back and watch more. We have lots of vocabulary and ideas generation videos that you can watch on our YouTube channel.

You don't have to show off or try to speak with really high level words, your language, and this is from the band descriptors, needs to be natural with some less common words, idiomatic words.

The questions in this test are designed to simulate the ielt's faking test. Let's start What's your first name, please? Saskia Thanks Saskia, At the beginning of the IELTS test, you'll be required to provide an ID, but as this is a practice test, we don't need to do that today. I want to begin by talking about you Do you have a large family? I don't actually. It's just myself and my brother, so it's very tight knit. And how often do you speak to your family? Every day, I make sure to call my parents, both my mom and my dad, at least once a day, and my brother and I are very close, so I'm actually going over to see him after this. Because of the distance, I make it a point to, you know, call them every day. So we don't feel such a large gap. "

I try to, I know you're supposed to have like 6 l a day, that does not happen, but I try to keep a bottle on me as much as possible. And do you ever drink bottled water? I do, yes, because in Sri Lanka where I grew up, you don't actually drink water from the tap, you can't, you will get sick. But yeah, so I do drink quite a bit of bottled water now I want to talk about the sky, do you like to look at the sky? I do It's very peaceful and just calming to look at the sky. Do you prefer to look at the sky during the day or the night if you're not in the city? I think the night sky is stunning because you don't have the light pollution, so you just see a lot of stars and it's just beautiful. But if you are in the city, I can see why. The sky during the day is a lot more pleasing. "

She answers the questions very naturally, however, and this is an area where saski could maybe improve occasionally. Some of the questions she answers are a little bit short. When she gives the answer, she probably could elaborate a little bit more. So we talked about drinking bottled water, and she just said, yes, I do. And then she kind of felt the need afterwards to explain a little bit more. She didn't push herself quite as much, but then she spoke at length about the next topic. So just make sure that for every question that you answer, try to speak as much as possible. ",

She's talking as though she's talking to a friend, she's sitting back in her chair, she's looking directly at the examiner, great body language, it won't help you in your test, but it might make you feel a little bit more relaxed and confident in yourself. Good job. ",
                "output": "great. I'm going to give you a topic and I'd like you to talk about it for one to two minutes before you talk, you'll have one minute to think about what you're going to say and you can make notes if you wish. Here is a paper and pencil for making notes. Thank you. And here is your topic. I would like you to describe an older person who has inspired you. Okay, so remember you have one to two minutes for this, so don't worry if I stop you. I'll tell you when the time is up. Can you start speaking now, please? So an older person who has inspired me would be my mother. She is well, I know her because she is my mother and I don't see her very often because we live so far apart. But I make it a point to call her everyday, communicate, and literally if I'm doing something, she'll be on the phone there with me and I'm just talking like I'm just wasting time, but I am just talking. And the reason I find her so inspiring would be because she didn't finished, like she didn't go to university. She started, she got dragged into like, she got a modeling job, started that. And from that point on, she has gone on to, she is a director of finance at my parents' companies and she built buildings for like, she built the office buildings herself, she built a house herself and she didn't have the educational background that so many people think is necessary. Sorry for you to do so many things with your life, but she has done everything, and she's one of the most intelligent people that you would ever meet, like you can have a conversation with her. And you'd think that she was the most learned scholar, but really, she just has an opinion and she just goes with it. And she'll make sure she knows. She makes sure that she knows, you know, that her opinion exists and it's valid. And yeah. So that's why I find her so inspiring. It's just that she never let anything stop her when she grew up. She grew up in the height of the war back home in Sri Lanka, and she still didn't let that inhibit her getting an education or getting places in life. She always made sure that regardless of what happened, she and her family were well looked after. She was a working mom, but she always made sure that by the time 3 o'clock came and my brother and I were out of school, she was hands on, she would drive us to classes, take us back swimming, practice drama classes, this, that, and the other. She was very, very involved, which with a working mommy, you don't always expect, right? Thank you. "

Great, she elaborated on her answers, she gave her opinions, her thoughts explained about who the person was, who inspired her, gave details. She did look down at the card a couple of times, but that's normal. She looks for some prompts from the card, no major mistakes, great features of language, fantastic pronunciation, really top quality job. ",
                "output": "Now let's talk about older people generally who normally looks after older people in your country. Well, the family back home as much as possible. You wouldn't put anybody older into a home. You look after them yourself. You look after your parents yourself, because we have the idea that my mother looked after me. It's my turn to look after her. That's that's the sort of mentality, but I think now with the with migration becoming so big, you have a lot more people who put their parents in homes and then just just migrate to other countries like Australia, the UK, wherever else. But for the most part, we look after our parents and our older people. Does the government provide good social care for elderly people where you live? Not really because we are a developing country and because of that, I feel they don't actually take the time to make the space. And this sort of like, I don't know how best to explain this because it's such a complicated and dynamic thing because there's so much political involvement with the social lives of people. But somehow it's not always for the best. "

She started talking about one topic, and I think she was trying to buy herself a little bit more time and then completely change the way that she was going and expanded on her answer then. So this would be a completely normal thing to do, start talking a little bit about something and she's looking for ideas. This is content related hesitation, and we've spoken about that in a previous video. And then she realizes she has her answer and starts talking more totally normal to do that. ",
                "output": "And when it comes to having a good social program for older people, it's hard to say that it exists, not for a lack of trying, but it's just a lack of follow through. I think . "

                "input": "now if I listen to the substance of saskia's answer, she didn't actually explain too much about her thoughts, but she did give an answer. I think this was a tricky question. Remember that part 3 questions are always quite difficult. She didn't really give a reason for, whether the government really supports elderly people. She kind of skirted around the topic, but did give somewhat of a vague answer. And that's okay. There's no right or wrong answer in iolts you just have to be able to speak fluently, which she did. ",
                "output": "How can society ensure that older people are not neglected? I think it comes with teaching the younger generations to respect their elders because neglect, it's something that, you know, if you, if you see your parents neglected their parents, you're more likely to neglect your own. Does that make sense? And if you teach young kids that this is how you are supposed to care for somebody, regardless of how old they are or how valuable they are to you in your society, I think then you'd make sure that, you know, there's less neglect going on of older people, right? Thank you very much. That is the end of the speaking test. "

                "input": "Wow, a little bit shorter today. Normally in a speaking test would be about 10 minutes long. This was a little bit shorter, it was a mock test, a practice test. What did you think of Saskia, in her speech, I was really thoroughly impressed. She speaks so well, so confidently. And remember, we talked about confidence today. She answers really naturally. Sometimes you'll find her looking up, looking for ideas, but that's completely normal. Remember, on the test day, you're gonna be nervous and you're gonna be facing the examiner that maybe doesn't give you any emotions back, so don't be put off by that. Try to just speak as naturally and as honestly as possible. I was really impressed. And I think a typical examiner in this particular case would score 9 for fluency and coherence. She spoke at length 9 for lexical resource, 9 for grammatical range and accuracy, and 9 for pronunciation. Sh. This was an example of an excellent band 9 speaking answer, so well done to Saskia, if you watched her previous video, she did make a small, a pronunciation mistake and lots of people said, how can the examiner be so strict in pronunciation? Well, that that's just how the test works I'm afraid, so be prepared for a really strict examiner today. Saskia did fantastically well, so good job to her. If you like these videos, please share them with your friends. Come back and watch more. We have lots of vocabulary and ideas generation videos that you can watch on our YouTube channel.

I mean, at least I would pick out my outfit like two months in advance. It would be like a little dress, like a princessy frock, matching shoes, matching accessories for your hair. And then you would take some kind of chocolate or candy to school, and then you could take like a period off and go and give the candy out to other teachers and other kids in the school.

The first time I met a new friend. So I'm going to go way back. It was my first day of school, kindergarten, kindergarten, and I met a girl named Aman treat. She we were about, I think we just turned four years old, we met obviously in kindergarten, first year of school. What I liked about her when I first saw her, I mean, we were sitting together with the teacher, made us sit next to each other. And she had this long hair and it was like sectioned into two parts, and it was just braided all the way down. And she had the cutest face I've ever seen. She had this little fluffy marshmallow like face. I guess that's all it takes when you're a kid to want to be friendly with somebody. And then I tried to, so there's like this little thing that kids do where they put their thumb out to show other kids that I wanna be your friend. And then if you don't want to be friends with them, you do this. It's like a, it's silly little thing. So I did this to her. I put my thumb out to say, hey, do you want to be friends? And she was like this, and I was heartbroken. I was like, how can she know, want to be my friend? And then I saw her again the next day. And the day, the next day after that, and the day after that. And then eventually we ended up becoming best friends. She did it back to me. Obviously at some point, she was my first best friend that I ever had in life. She was from Punjab, which is a part of India, and her mom used to make the most amazing, it's called parata, it's like the stuffed bread. It's like they put a potato and spices into like, into a flatbread. And my mom used to make something called cedar, which is sweet semolina situation. "

And in some cases I have seen parents interfering and trying to make those decisions for their children where they were right to do so because the child was in bad company and they were too naive or to, I mean, I guess they were just too naive to see that that situation was not right for them. But their parent obviously was able to identify that my child's in bad company. So in those cases, I would say that your parents are able to read a dangerous situation better, but there's also the flip side where everybody kind of does make bad decisions, your parents made bad decisions, you made bad decisions and the way that you learn from them is to have a negativist experience and then find your way out of it. So I would say that I can see certain situations, whether it's bad relationships, bad friendships, when you're younger, not relationships, when you're younger friendships, when you're younger, sometimes it's necessary to have that experience, so that, you know, firsthand how to deal with that situation.

Everything is kind of edited, edited and monitored to present a certain kind of image. So if you meet somebody online and you know nothing about them, they can really present any version of reality or a completely curated, sometimes dishonest form of their reality to you.

I mean, the older that you get, the more set you get in your ways, your routine, where you work, your family, your gym, children for children becomes. It's very easy for children to interact with other children. Like if you put two kids in a room in three seconds, you're talking to each other without any restrictions. They're talking about all of their family secrets and everything. You know, they're, they're comfortable, but with adults, obviously people tend to be more filtered when they interact with other adults. Also, I think if you've been friends from the time that you were a child with somebody, you've lived through so many life events together that that kind of bond is hard to build with someone that you meet in your mid 30s because you've just lost so much time that you're learning something, you're learning about them from scratch where they went to school, about their family, about their relationships, about their siblings.

They're not being unfriendly, they just have a job to do and they're trying to think about your grammar and your vocabulary and your pronunciation and your fluency, and there's a lot going on there. Yeah, and for them, they cannot start to interact with you. Yeah, and on test day, you might not get a very friendly examiner like me. I don't know whether I was friendly, but they might be like, you know, don't do anything. Or some of them could, you know, be having a bad day and they just like, don't ask questions. Now I have experienced with, with not myself, but other students have said when they did that, they thought the examiner was criticizing them or being rude. They took that to heart and thought, oh my God, I failed my test. And they went from doing very, very well to everything fell apart because if you feel nervous, yeah, you feel uncomfortable with someone, then it really affects your fluency. You can clam up. You don't want to really show your language and who you are. You don't wanna, because one of the great, advantages are, are great strength that you have is you've, you're very open about who you are as a person. And that's great because it allows you to speak in a very fluent way if you go and do the test for real, probably don't interact with the examiner, enter as much. Part 2, you did a great job because you just picked a real event, a real person from your life. And it's much easier to talk about that. Some students try to pick something high level or impressive to impress the examiner. There's no such thing. The best thing to do is pick something from your real life cause that's easy to talk about. Part 3, you did very, very well because you really extended your answers. Again, you use real situations from your own life. You don't have to do that, but it really did help you develop your answers. Terms of the scores, pronunciation is pretty much perfect. The examiner will be thinking about, can I understand every word this person is saying Hundred percent. I can understand every syllable. Then the examiner will be thinking about high level pronunciation features such as your intonation. So our voices go up, our voices go down. You speak like a native English speaker in that respect, sentence stress is when we emphasize certain words. This is my phone, not your phone. So you emphasize certain words at times. Again, you do that 100 percent. Naturally, and then you use connected speech the way in native English speakers talk. We wouldn't say, I want to talk about my friend, say I want to talk about my friend, the flow of the language. So absolutely perfect, no problems there. Coherence and fluency. Coherence is, did you answer the questions, did you develop them enough? You did that 100% of the time. And then fluency is, did you speak without any, unnatural pausing? You did pause at times, but the reason why you paused is important. So in the last, I think it was the second last question, you were talking about adults and you were saying their lives are more structured, so you weren't trying to think of the correct vocabulary because your English isn't good enough. You were trying to just formulate your thoughts and come up with the appropriate precise word, which you did. So that demonstrates to the examiner that you have a very high level of vocabulary cause if you were, cause you're trying to think of the current word, what's the word? What a, so when people don't really know the language, then they would stop. And also because you approach this not as a test, but more as a conversation and you are very open and talk about your, your life in a very open way that really helps with fluency. So again, top marks for fluency and coherence grammar, I didn't hear a single grammar mistake. The examiner will be thinking about the accuracy of your grammar. Did you make any mistakes and the range of a grammar? So if I talk to you about a birthday party in the past, did you use the appropriate past tenses? And then I asked you about what what you do today, did you switch tenses, did you use the appropriate grammatical structures and tenses to talk about each each situation? And again, you did that perfectly, vocabulary, very natural. Use a nice mixture of just normal everyday words, which everybody uses, and you also use idiomatic language very, very well. So as you can see, you're using very natural, natural English and overall you would get a perfect band line. Oh, wow, which is very rare. Use a nice mixture of just normal everyday words, which everybody uses, and you also use idiomatic language very, very well.

Oh, really? That's quite unusual, isn't it? Certainly is, and do staff gets free uniforms too? You just need to wear a white T shirt and black trousers it says here, so I guess not, but another benefit of working for a big company like this is that you can get a discount at any of their restaurants, even at weekends. No, but you'll be working then anyway. Oh yes, I suppose so. Most of their restaurants are in the city center, aren't they so easy to get to by bus? Yes, that's right, but if you have to do a late shift and finished work after midnight, the company will pay for you to get a taxi home. I probably won't need one. I think I'd use my bike. Okay, now they do have some quite specific requirements for the kind of person they're looking for. Milo's is a young, dynamic company and they're really keen on creating a strong team.

So you're probably familiar, familiar with the kind of responsibilities involved. Obviously checking that all the portions are correct, etc.. And then things like checking all the procedures for cleaning the equipment are being followed. Okay, and what about the salary? In my last job, I was getting 9 pounds 50 per hour. I was hoping to get a bit more than that. Well, to begin with, you'd be getting 9 pounds 75, but that goes up to ￡11 25 after three months. That's not too bad. And I suppose it's a very early start. That's the only unattractive thing about this job. But then you have the afternoons and evenings free, so the restaurant starts serving breakfast from 7 AM and you'd have to be there at 5 30 to set everything up, but you'd be finisheded at 1230. Well, as you say, there are advantages to that. Now, you might also be interested in the job at the city road branch, that's for a junior chef, so again, a position of responsibility, I might prefer that actually, right? Well, obviously this role would involve supporting the sue chef and other senior staff, and you'd be responsible for making sure there's enough stock each week and sorting out all the deliveries. I've never done that before, but I imagine it's fairly straightforward once you get the hang of it. Yes, and you'd be working alongside more experienced staff to begin with, so I'm sure it wouldn't be a problem. The salary is slightly higher here, it's an annual salary of ￡23000, right? I know that if they like you, it's likely you'll be promoted quite quickly, so that's worth thinking about. Yes, it does sound interesting. What are the hours like?

Part 2, you will hear a talk to members of the public about plans for a new housing development near a town called nanston. First, you have some time to look at questions 11 to 14. Now listen carefully and answer questions. Questions 11 to 14. Hello, everyone. It's good to see that so many members of the public have shown up for our presentation on the new housing development planned on the outskirts of nanston. I'm Mark Reynolds, and I'm communications manager at the development. I'll start by giving you a brief overview of our plans for the development. So one thing I'm sure you'll want to know is why we've selected this particular site for a housing development, a present. It's being used for farming, like much of the land around nanston. But because of the new industrial centre in nanston, there's a lot of demand for housing for employees in the region, as many employees are having to commute long distances at present. Of course, there's also the fact that we have an international airport just 20 minutes drive away. But although that's certainly convenient, it wasn't one of our major criteria, criteria for choosing the site. We were more interested in the fact that there's an excellent hospital just 15 km away and a large secondary school even closer than that. One drawback to the site is that it's on quite a steep slope, but we've taken account of that in our planning, so it shouldn't be a major problem. We've had a lot of positive feedback about the plans. People like the wide variety of accommodation types and prices, and the fact that it's only a short drive to get out into the countryside from the development. We were particularly pleased that so many people like the designs for the layout of the development, with the majority of people saying it generally made a good impression and blended him well with the natural features of the landscape, with provision made for protecting trees and wildlife on the site. Some people have mentioned that they'd like to see more facilities for cyclists, and we'll look at that. But the overall feedback has been that the design and facilities of the development make it seem a place where people of all ages can live together happily. Before you hear the rest of the talk, you have some time to look at questions 15 to 20. Now listen and answer questions. Questions 15 to 20. Okay, so I'll put a map of the proposed development up on the screen. You'll see it's bounded on the south side by the main road, which then goes on to nanston. Another boundary is formed by London Road on the western side of the development. Inside the development, there'll be about 400 houses and 3 apartment blocks. There'll also be a school for children up to 11 years old. If you look at the south entrance at the bottom of the map, there's a road from there that goes right up through the development. The school will be on that road at the corner of the second, Turning to the left, a large sports centre is planned with facilities for indoor and outdoor activities. This will be on the western side of the development, just below the road that branches off from London Road. There'll be a clinic where residents can go if they have any health problems. Can you see the lake towards the top of the map? The clinic will be just below this to the right of a street of houses. There'll also be a community centre for people of all ages. On the northeast side of the development, there'll be a row of specially designed houses specifically for residents over 65, and the community center will be adjoining this. We haven't forgotten about shopping, there'll be a supermarket between the two entrances to the development, we're planning to leave the three large trees near London Road, and it'll be just to the south of these. It's planned to have a playground for younger children. If you look at the road that goes up from the south entrance, you'll see it curves round to the left at the top and the playground will be in that curve with nice views of the lake. Okay, so now does anyone have any question? That is the end of part 2. You now have 30 seconds to check your answers to part 2. Part 3 you will hear two geography students, Adam and Michelle, talking about a volcanic eruption which took place in Iceland in 1783. First, you have some time to look at questions 21 to 26. Now listen carefully and answer questions, questions twentyone to twentysix. Now listen carefully and answer questions, questions twentyone to twentysix. ",
                "output": "So, Michelle, shall we make a start on our presentation? We haven't got that much time left. No, Adam, but at least we've done all the background reading. I found it really interesting. I'd never even heard of the larky eruption before this. Me neither, I suppose 1783 is a long time ago, but it was a huge eruption and it had such devastating consequences. I know it was great. There were so many primary source is to look at. It really gives you a sense of how catastrophic the volcano was. People were really trying to make sense of the science for the first time. That's right, but what I found more significant was how we impacted directly and indirectly on political events, as well as having massive social and economic consequences. I know that should be the main focus of our presentation, The observations made by people at the time were interesting, weren't they? I mean, they all gave a pretty consistent account of what happened, even if they didn't always use the same terminology. Yeah, I was surprised there were so many weather stations established by that time. So, you know, you can see how the weather changed often by the hour, right? Writers at the time talked about the lucky haze to describe the volcanic fog that spread across Europe. They all realized that this wasn't the sort of fog they were used to, and of course, this was in preindustrial times, so they hadn't experienced sulfur smelling fog before. No, that's true. Reports from the period blamed the haze for an increase in headaches, respiratory issues, and asthma attacks, and they all describe how it covered the sun and made it look a strange red color. Must have been very weird. It's interesting that Benjamin Franklin wrote about the haze, did you read that he was the American ambassador in Paris at the time? Yeah, at first, no one realized that the haze was caused by the volcanic eruption in Iceland. It was Benjamin Franklin who realized that before anyone else. He's often credited with that, apparently, but a French naturalist beat him to it. I can't remember his name. I'd have to look it up then Other naturalists had the same idea, all independently of each other. Oh, right, We should talk about the immediate impact of the eruption, which was obviously enormous, especially in Iceland, where so many people died. You'd expect that, and the fact that the volcanic ash drifted so swiftly, but not that the effects would go on for so long or that two years after the eruption, strange weather events were being reported as far away as North America and North Africa. No, I found all that hard to believe too. It must have been terrible and there was nothing any one could do about it, even if they knew the ash cloud was coming in their direction. "

                "output": "We should run through some of the terrible consequences of the eruption experienced in different countries. There's quite a varied range, starting with Iceland, where the impact on farming was devastating. One of the most dramatic things there was the effect on livestock as they grazed in the fields. They were poisoned because they yet vegetation that had been contaminated with fluorine as a result of the volcanic fallout. That was horrible. In Egypt, the bizarre weather patterns led to a severe drought, and as a result, the Nile didn't flood, which meant the crops all failed. It's so far from where the eruption happened, and yet the famine there led to more people dying than any other country. It was worse than the plague. Okay, then in the UK, the mortality rate went up a lot, presumably from respiratory illnesses. According to one report, it was about double the usual number and included an unusually high percentage of people under the age of 25. I think people will be surprised to hear that the weather in the USA was badly affected too. George Washington even makes a note in his diary that they were snowbound until March in Virginia. That was before he became president. Yes, and there was ice floating down the Mississippi, which was unprecedented, astonishing really. Anyway, what do you think we should include next? "

                "output": "Good morning. Now, we've been asked to choose an aspect of European clothing or fashion and to talk about its development over time. I decided to focus on a rather small area of clothing, and that's pockets. I chose pockets for two reasons, really, you all have them in jeans, jackets, coats, for example, and even though we often carry bags or briefcases as well, nothing is quite as convenient as being able to pop your phone or credit card into your pocket yet. I suspect that other than that, people don't really think about pockets too much and they're rather overlooked as a fashion item. It's certainly very interesting to go back in time and see how pockets developed for men and women. In the 18th century. Fashions were quite different from the way they are now, and pockets were too. If we think about male fashion first, that was the time when suits became popular. Trousers were knee length only and referred to as breeches. The waistcoats were short and the jackets were long, but all three garments were lined with material and pockets were sewn into this cloth by whichever Taylor the customer used. The wearer could then carry small objects, such as pencils or coins on their person and reach them through a gap in the lining. Coat pockets became increasingly decorative on the outside for men who wanted to look stylish, but they were often larger but plainer if the wearer was someone with a profession who needed to carry medical instruments, a doctor or physician, for example. The development of women's pockets was a little different. For one thing, they weren't nearly as visible or as easy to reach as men's. In the 18th and 19th centuries, women carried numerous possessions on their person, and some of these could be worth a lot of money. Women were more vulnerable to theft, and wealthy women in particular worried constantly about pickpockets. So what they did was to have a pair of pockets made that were tied together with string. The pockets were made of fabric, which might be recycled cloth if the wearer had little money or something more expensive, such as linen, sometimes featuring very delicate embroidery. Women tied the pockets around their waist so that they hung beneath their clothes. Remember, skirts were long then, and there was plenty of room to hide a whole range of small possessions between the layers of petticoats that were commonly worn. They would have an opening in the folds of their skirts, through which they could reach whatever they needed, like their perfume. Working women. Women, of course, also needed to carry around items that they might use for whatever job or trade they were involved in, but their pairs of pockets still remained on the inside of their clothing. They just got bigger or longer, sometimes reaching down to their knees. So the tie on pockets went well into the 19th century and only changed when fashion altered towards the end of that period. That's when dresses became tighter and less bulky, and the pairs of pockets became very noticeable. They stood out too much and detracted from the woman's image. Women who had been used to carrying around a range of personal possessions and still wanted to needed somewhere to carry these items about their person. That was when small bags or pouches, as they were known, came into fashion. And of course, they inevitably led on to the handbag of more modern times, particularly when fashion removed pockets altogether. "

                "input": "Thank you very much. Well, I need to start by talking about safety. You really need to know what you're doing because some mushrooms are extremely poisonous. Having said that, once you know what to look for, it's really worth doing for the amazing variety of mushrooms available, which you can't get in the shops. But of course, you have to be very careful. And that's why I always say you should never consume mushrooms picked by friends or neighbours. Always remember that some poisonous mushrooms look very similar to edible ones, and it's easy for people to get confused. The other thing to avoid is mushrooms growing beside busy roads for obvious reasons, but nothing beats the taste of freshly picked mushrooms. Don't forget that the ones in the shops are often several days old and past their best. There are certain ideas about wild mushrooms that it's important to be aware of. Don't listen to people who tell you that it's only okay to eat mushrooms that are pale or dull. This is completely untrue. Some edible mushrooms are bright red, for example. Personally, I prefer mushrooms cooked, but it won't do you any harm to eat them uncooked in salads, It's not necessary to peel them Another thing you should remember is that you can't tell if a mushroom is safe to eat by its smell. Some of the most deadly mushroom have no smell and taste quite nice apparently, apparently finally, just because deer or squirrels eat a particular mushroom doesn't mean that you can. Before you hear the rest of the talk, you have some time to look at questions 15 to 20. Now listen and answer questions 15 to 20. Of course, mushroom picking is associated with the countryside, but if you haven't got a car, your local park can be a great place to start. There are usually a range of habitats where mushrooms grow, such as playing fields and wooded areas, but you need to be there first thing in the morning as there's likely to be a lot of competition not just from people but wildlife too. The deer often get the best mushrooms in my local park. If you're a complete beginner, I wouldn't recommend going alone or relying on photos in a book, even the one I've written. There are some really good phone apps for identifying mushrooms, but you can't always rely on getting a good signal in the middle of a wood. If possible, you should go with a group led by an expert. You'll stay safe and learn a lot that way. Conservation is a really important consideration, and you must follow a few basic rules. You should never pick all the mushrooms in one area, collect only enough for your own needs, be very careful that you don't trample on young mushrooms or other plants, and make sure you don't pick any mushrooms that are endangered and protected. By law. There's been a decline in some varieties of wild mushrooms in this part of the country. Restaurants are becoming more interested in locally sourced food like wild mushrooms, but the biggest problem is that so many new houses have been built in this area in the last 1010 years, and more water is being taken from rivers and reservoirs because of this. And mushroom habitats have been destroyed. Anyway, a word of advice on storing mushrooms? Collect them in a brown paper bag and as soon as you get home, put them in the fridge. They'll be fine for a couple of days, but it's best to cook them as soon as possible after washing them really carefully first, of course, so everybody knows what a mushroom tastes like, right? Well, you'll be surprised by the huge variety of wild mushrooms there are. Be adventurous, they're great in so many dishes, stir fries, risottos, pasta, but just be aware that some people can react badly to certain varieties, so it's a good idea not to eat huge quantities to begin with. Okay, so now I'm going to show you a few examples of poisonous. That is the end of part 2. You now have 30 seconds to check your answers to part 2.

                "output": "That seminar yesterday on automation and the future of work was really good, wasn't it? Looking at the first industrial Revolution in Britain in the 19th century and seeing how people reacted to massive change was a real eye opener. Yes, it was interesting to hear how people felt about Ultimate then and what challenges they faced. I didn't know that first started with workers in the textile industry, with those protesting workers called the Luddites destroying their knitting machines because they were so worried about losing their jobs. Yes, and ultimately they didn't achieve anything. And anyway, industrialization created more jobs than it destroyed. Yes, that's true, but it probably didn't seem a positive thing at the time. I can see why the Luddites felt so threatened. I know. I'm sure I would have felt the same. The discussion about the future of work was really optimistic for a change. I like the idea that work won't involve doing boring, repetitive tasks, as robots will do all that. Normally you only hear negative stuff about the future bit too optimistic, don't you think? For example, I can't see how people are about to have more leisure time when all the evidence shows shows people are spending longer than ever at work. No, that's true. And what about lower unemployment? I'm not so sure about that, perhaps in the long term, but not in the foreseeable future. And I expect most people will be expected to work until they're much older as everyone's living much longer. That's already happening. "

                "output": "I enjoyed all that stuff on how technology has changed some jobs and how they're likely to change in the near future. Yeah, incredible. Like a countenance, you might think all the technological innovations would have put them out of a job, but in fact, there are more of them than ever. They're still really in demand and have become far more efficient, right? That was amazing. 20 times more accountants in this country compared to the 19th century. I know I'd never have thought the demand for hairdressing would have gone up so much in the last hundred years. One hairdresser for every 287 people now compared to one for over 1500. Yeah, because people's earning power has gone up so they can afford to spend more on personal services like that. But technology hasn't changed the actual job that much. No, they've got hair dryers, etc.. But it's one job where you don't depend on a computer, The kind of work that administrative staff do has changed enormously thanks to technology. Even 20 years ago, there were secretaries doing dictation and typing. Yes, really boring compared to these days when they're given much more responsibility and higher status. A lot of graduates go in for this kind of work now. I'd expected there to be a much bigger change in the number of agricultural workers in the 19th century, but the 18 seventyone census showed that roughly twentyfive percent of the population worked on the land. Yeah I'd have assumed it would be more, more than 50%. Now it's less than nought point 2%. What about care workers? They barely existed in the 19th century as people's lifespan was so much shorter, but now of course this sector will see huge growth. Yeah, and it's hard enough to meet current demand. The future looks quite bleak for bank class. They've been in decline since ATMs were introduced in the 80s and technology will certainly make most of the jobs they do now redundant. I think I agree, although the situation may change, it's very hard to predict what will happen. "

                "output": "In today's astronomy lecture I'm going to talk about the need for a system to manage the movement of satellites and other objects in orbit around the Earth. In other words, a space traffic management system. We already have effective air traffic control systems that are used internationally to ensure that planes navigate our skies safely. Well, space traffic management is a similar concept, but focusing on the control of satellites. The aim of such a system would be to prevent the danger of collisions in space between the objects in orbit around the Earth. In order to do this, we'd need to have a set of legal measures, and we'd also have to develop the technical systems to enable us to prevent such accidents. But unfortunately, at present, we don't actually have a space traffic management system that works, so why not? What are the problems in developing such a system? Well, for one thing, satellites are relatively cheap these days compared with how they were in the past, meaning that more people can afford to put them into space, so there's a lot more of them out there. And people aren't just launching single satellites, but whole constellations consisting of thousands of them designed to work together. So space is getting more crowded every day. But in spite of this one thing you may be surprised to learn is that you can launch a satellite into space, and once it's out there, it doesn't have to send back any information to Earth to allow its identification. So while we have international systems for ensuring we know where the planes in our skies are and to prevent them from colliding with one another when it comes to the safety of satellites, at present we don't have anything like enough proper ways of tracking them. And it isn't just entire satellites that we need to consider. A greater threat is the huge amount of space debris in orbit around the Earth, broken bits of satellite and junk from space stations and so on. And some of these are so small that they can be very hard to identify, but they can still be very dangerous. In addition, some operators may be unwilling to share information about the satellites they've launched. For example, a satellite may be designed for military purposes, or it may have been launched for commercial reasons. And the operators don't want competitors to have information about it. And even if the operators are willing to provide it, the information isn't easy to collect. Details are needed about the object itself, as well as about its location at a particular time. And remember that a satellite isn't very big, and it's likely to be moving at thousands of kilometers an hour. We don't have any sensors that can constantly follow something moving so fast. So all that the scientists can do is to put forward a prediction concerning where the satellite is heading there next. So those are some of the problems that we're facing. Let's consider now some of the solutions that have been suggested. One key issue is the way in which information is dealt with. We need more information, but it also needs to be accessible at a global level, so we need to establish shared standards that we can all agree on for the way in which this information is presented. We already do this in other areas of science. So although this is a challenge, it's not an impossible task. Then as all this information's collected, it needs to be put together so it can be used, and that will involve creating a single database on which it can be entered As we continue to push forward new developments, congestion of the space environment is only going to increase. To cope with this, we need to develop a system like the one I've described to coordinate the work of the numerous spacecraft operators. But it's also essential that this system is one that establishes trust in the people that use it both nationally and at a global level. One interesting development that I'll mention at this. "

And you did mention your work at the sports center when you came in to see us. Yes, in fact, I enjoyed that job. Is there anything else they're looking for? Well, they say it's quite a high pressure environment. They're always very busy and patients are often under stress. So they want someone who can cope with that and stay calm and at the same time be confident when interacting with the public. Well, after dealing with three children all under 5, I reckon I can cope with that. I'm sure you can. And then another thing they mention is that they're looking for someone with good I t skills. Not a problem. So you'd be interested in following this up. Sure, when would it start? Well, they're looking for someone from the beginning of next month, but I should tell you that this isn't a permanent job, it's temporary, so the contract would be just to the end of septic, but they do say that there could be further opportunities after that. Okay, and what would the hours be? Well, they want someone who can start at a quarter to 8 in the morning, could you manage that? Yes, my husband would have to get the kids up and off to my mother's, she's going to be looking after them while I'm at work What time would I finished 1 15? That should work out all right, I can pick the kids up on my way home, and then I'll have the afternoon with them. Oh, one thing, is there parking available for staff at the centre? Yes, there is, and it's also on a bus route, right? Well, I expect I'll have the car, but it's good to know that. Okay, so where do I go from here? Well, if you are happy for me to do so I'll forward your CV and references and then the best thing would probably be for you to phone them so they can arrange for an interview.

I understand it's your first visit here, so I'd like to give you some background information about the museum and then explain a little about what you can see during your visit. So where we're standing at the moment is the entrance to a large building that was constructed in 1880 as the home of a local businessman, Alfred Palmer of the Palmer Biscuit Factory. It was later sold and became a hall of residence for students in 1911 and a museum in 1951. In 2005, a modern extension was built to accommodate the museum's collections, the museums owned by the university and apart from two rooms that are our offices, the university uses the main part of the building. You may see students going into the building for lessons, but it's not open to museum visitors. I'm afraid it's a shame because the interior architectural features are outstanding, especially the room that used to be the library. Luckily, we've managed to keep entry to the museum free. This includes access to all the galleries, outdoor areas and the rooms for special exhibitions. We run activities for children and students such as the Museum Club, for which there is no charge. We do have a donation box just over there, so feel free, free to give whatever amount you consider appropriate. We do have a cloakroom if you'd like to leave your coats and bag somewhere. Unlike other museums, photography is allowed here, so you might like to keep your cameras with you. You might be more comfortable not carrying around heavy rucksacks though.

Children absolutely love it, but then so do adults. The main galleries called Town and Country. It includes a photographic collection of prize winning sheep and shepherds leaving town and country. You enter Farmhouse Kitchen, which is well, self explanatory. Here we have the oldest collection of equipment for making butter and cheese in the country and this morning a specialist cheesemaker will be giving demonstrations of how it's produced. He may even get to try some. After that. You can go in two directions. To the right is a staircase that takes you up to a landing from where you can look down on the galleries. To the left is a room called a year on the farm. There is lots of seating here as sometimes we use the room for school visits, so it's a good place to stop for a rest. If you're feeling competitive, you can take our memory test in which you answer questions about things you've seen in the museum. The next area is called Wagon Walk. This contains farm carts from nearly every part of the country. It's surprising how much regional variation there was. Beside the carts are display boards with information about each one. The carts are old and fragile, so we ask you to keep your children close to you and ensure they don't climb on the carts. From Wagon Walk, you can either make your way back to reception or go out into the garden, or even go back to take another look in the galleries. In the far corner of the garden is Bees are Magic, but we're redeveloping this area, so you can't visit that at the moment. You can still buy our honey in the shop though. Finally, there is the pond which contains all kinds of interesting wildlife. There are baby ducks that are only a few days old as well as tiny frogs. The pond isn't deep and there is a fence around it, so it's perfectly safe for children. "

Can you all work with a person sitting sitting next to you? I had no idea that such a simple thing like folding squares of paper to make the shape of something like a bird could be such an amazing tool. It's made me see origami in a whole new light. I know it was interesting to see the educational skills the children were developing by doing origami on the video. You could see them really listening hard to make sure they did all the steps in the right order to make the bird. That's right. In this lesson, they were working individually, but it would also be interesting to see if the children could work out how to make something simple without being given any direction that would help with building teamwork as well. Yes, but much more of a challenge. One thing that really stood out for me was that the children were all having fun while being taught something new, which is a key aim of any lesson with this age group. And although these kids had no problems with folding the paper with younger children, you could do origami to help practice fine motor skills, absolutely. Shall we talk about the individual children we saw on the video? I wrote all their names down and took some notes. Yes, I did too. Okay, good. Let's start with Sid. He was interesting because before they started doing the origami, he was being quite disruptive. Yes, he really benefited from having to use his hands, it helped him to settle down and start concentrating. Yes, I noticed that too What about Jack? I noticed he seemed to want to work the things out for himself. You could see him trying out different things rather than asking the teacher for help. What did you make of Naomi? She seemed to be losing interest at one point, but then she decided she wanted her mouse to be the best and that motivated her to try harder. She didn't seem satisfied with hers in the end though. No Ania was such a star. She listened so carefully and then produced the perfect bird with very little effort. I think the teacher could have increased the level of difficulty for her, maybe? I think it was the first time Zara had come across origami. She looked as if she didn't really get what was going on, she seemed unsure about what she was supposed to do, but in the end hers didn't turn out too badly. Yeah I'm sure it was a positive learning experience for her. "

I think it would have taken the ages to prepare examples showing each of the steps involved in making the bird, but that was a really good idea. The children could see what the they were aiming for and much better for them to be able to hold something rather than just looking at pictures. Those physical examples supported her verbal explanations really well. It's strange that origami isn't used more widely. Why do you think that is, well, teachers may just feel it's not that appealing to children who are used to doing everything on computers, especially boys, even if they're aware of the benefits. Oh, I don't know. It's no different to any other craft activity. I bet it's because so many teachers are clumsy like me. That's true, too much effort required if you're not good with your hands. Well, anyway, I think we should try it out in our maths teaching practice with year 3, I can see using origami is a really engaging way of reinforcing children's knowledge of geometric shapes like they were doing in the video. But I think it would also work really well for fractions, which is coming up soon. Good idea. That's something most of the kids in that class might struggle with. Origami would also be good practice for using symmetry, but I think they did that last term. Okay, well, let's try and get some ideas together and plan the lesson next week. Okay, if you could. "

Now listen carefully and answer questions 31 to 40. Now listen carefully and answer questions 31 to 40. ",
                "output": "The person I've chosen to talk about is the French writer Victor Hugo. Many people have heard of him because his novel lay miserable, which he wrote in 18 sixtytwo is famous around the world. It became a stage musical in the 1980s, and a film version was also released in 2012. So some of us I'm sure have a pretty general idea of the plot, but we know much less about the author. Today I'm going to provide a little more insight into this talented man, and I'm going to talk particularly about the home he had on the island of gurnnsey in the British Channel Islands. But first, his early career. As I've said, he was a writer. He was at the height of his career in Paris, and he was very highly regarded by his colleagues. As far as literature was concerned, he was the leading figure of the romantic movement. However, as well as being a literary genius, he also gave many speeches about issues like the level of poverty in his society. He felt very strongly about this and about other areas where change was needed, like education. This kind of outspoken criticism was not well liked by the rulers of France, and eventually the Emperor Napoleon the third told Victor Hugo to leave Paris and not return. In other words, he sent him into exile. So Victor Hugo was forced to reside in other parts of Europe. Guernsey was actually his third place of exile, and he landed there in 1855. He produced a lot while on gurnsey, including lame, miserable, and to do this he had to spend a great deal of time in the home that he had there. This was a property that he bought using the money he'd made in France from the publication of a collection of his poetry. It was the only property he ever owned, and he was very proud of it. The property Victor Hugo bought on Guernsey was a large five story house in the capital town of Saint Peter Port, and he lived there for 15 years, returning to France in 1870 when Napoleon's empire collapsed. He decorated and furnished each level or floor of the house in unique and wonderful ways, and many people consider the inside of the house to be a work of art. Today, it's a museum that attracts 200000 visitors a year. He lived in the house with his family, and portraits of its members still hang in rooms on the ground floor, along with drawings that he did during his travels that he felt were important to him. In other ground floor rooms, there are huge tapestries that he would have designed and loved. The walls are covered in dark wood paneling that Victor Hugo created himself using wooden furniture that he bought in the market. The items were relatively inexpensive, and he used them to create intricate carvings. They gave an atmosphere on the lower level that was shadowy and rather solemn. On the next level of the house, there are two impressive lounges where he entertained his guests. One lounge has entirely red furnishings such as sofas and wall coverings, and the other blue. There's a strong Chinese influence in these areas in things like the wallpaper pattern and the lamps, which he would have made himself by copying original versions. His library, where he left many of his favourite books, forms the hallway to the third floor and was a comfortable area where he could relax and enjoy his afternoons. And then at the very top of the house, there's a room called the Lookout. Call that because it looks out over the harbour, in contrast to the rather dark lower levels, it's full of light and was like a glass office where he would write until lunchtime, often at his desk. So Victor Hugo was a man of many talents, but he was also true to his values. While living in his house on Guernsey, he entertained many other famous writers, but he also invited a large group of local children from the deprived areas of the island to dinner once a week. What's more, he served them their food, which was an extraordinary gesture for the time period. In 1927. The house was owned by his relatives and they decided to donate it to the city of Paris. It has since been restored using photographs from the period and as I mentioned earlier, is now a museum that is open to the public. "

You mean you will have your mark, in a couple days online and you'll have the official certificate with the other sections in a couple of weeks? Have a great rest of your day. Thanks, bye bye. For this performance on a bad day Yumi would get a band 8, 5. On a good day she would get a band 9. This is because she is clearly between a very good and expert user of the English language yumi's fluency and coherence are top level. She doesn't pause much at all to think about ideas. She expresses herself clearly and with lots of details, giving explanations and examples. Furthermore Yumi uses a wide range of grammar and she has excellent lexical resource, including phrasal verbs and idioms. Yumi has a slight Japanese pronunciation. However, her diction and her pronunciation are very clear, and it's easy to understand her for these reasons. Umi could very well get a perfect score. Now, here are some points to remember when you are doing the computer based video chat version of the IELTS exam. Follow these tips and you will get a higher score when doing the computer based video chat version of the Outspeaking interview. Firstly, it's important to position yourself comfortably in your chair and make sure that your headset and microphone are also comfortable. Now, when you're speaking through a computer camera and microphone, these act as filters, so you need to be melodramatic. This means that you want to emphasize about 10% more than usual. In this way, you will seem natural to the examiner. Also, don't forget to use facial gestures. Smile smiling gives you confidence. Nod when the examiner asks you a question. This shows acknowledgment, of course, in the video chat, you can't really use hand gestures too much because only the upper torso and head are visible, so facial features become more important. Next, blame the equipment if you miss a question or if you don't catch a question the first time, you can get away with blaming the equipment once, maybe twice. Don't do it often. You can say I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you there. Can you please repeat that? Or you can say I'm sorry, that wasn't too clear. Maybe something's up with my headset. Can you please repeat that again once or twice? You could do this and the examiner will repeat the questions. However, it might get suspicious if you do it more as well when you are doing the computer based exam, pay attention to looking into the camera rather than just at the screen. This will give the feeling of eye contact for the examiner. It's a good idea to train your eyes to look into the camera while also looking at at the face of the examiner through your periphery. In addition, visualize and pretend that the examiner is there in the room with you. This will make your speech feel more personable, it will be more real, These details will certainly add to the quality of your communication. And finally, this is very important. Pay attention to fluency and giving complete answers often when people are talking through a video camera, they tend to keep their answers. Breathe, however, in the IELTS you must show your maximum English level in the given time, this means that you should always pay attention to giving an answer, an explanation, and often including examples. Don't let the camera track you into giving very short answers because that will restrict your band score. Speak fluently, Follow these points and you will certainly improve on your next aisle exam and remember to practice this at home with your friends or speaking partners online.

She is confident and fluid, keeping her hands on the table and expressing herself with a loud, clear voice. Notice how her range of grammar continues to expand with each question. She not only forms complex sentences with the independent and dependent clause, but she's able to switch that to the dependent and independent clause, like with the question, when do you use usually go on holidays? And she starts with the dependent clause. Since I am a student, I usually go on holidays, during the weekends and during vacations. It's this dynamic use of complex grammar that gets you those higher band scores. Again, remember the subordinating conjunctions that break into four categories, cause and effect, time, condition, and opposition. Make sure to practice these and practice not only the independent, dependent or main and subordinate clause, but also practice reversing this, stating the subordinate clause followed by the main clause. Furthermore, Amelia reflects the grammar of questions when asked. Have you ever traveled to a tropical country? She immediately recognizes that this is present perfect and states yes, I had learned this this trick to get that point when you get a question in the present perfect, have you ever? Yes, I have. No, I haven't. In this way, the examiner knows that you can understand and use this type of grammar. Next question is a conditional. If you could go anywhere, anywhere in the world, where would you like to travel? Here again, Amelia does a good job reflecting both the condition and the content, stating that if I could choose just one place, I would travel to Tokyo. Also notice that in this answer she makes a mistake but corrects herself. Self corrections are a great way to reach those high band 8. Band 9 scores. Make sure that if you make a mistake, whether in part 1, 2 or three, you stop and correct yourself, don't say sorry, don't apologize, just make the correction and move on. Now let's look at part 2. This part, I will show you some questions. You will have one minute to read these, think about your answers, then you will have one to two minutes to speak.

I know this doesn't sound too girly, but whatever. I like to get really competitive and I think I'm pretty good at it. I have a great ranking and it's always lots of excitement when I get a couple of hours to play. I usually play in the evenings and on the weekends for a few times each week. I would say around five hours or so. I'm getting quite busy with studies these days, so I don't get as much as time to play as I used to. My favorite part is not only really exciting, but it also requires a lot of strategy to outsmart other players. The graphics and sounds are outstanding. The game develops quick analytic thinking as well as hand eye coordination while having tons of fun. I don't think this game is for everyone because it's quite violent and fast, but however, if a person is really into VP S games, color of duty is definitely a game to try. I'm sure we'll be playing this games with my friends for a few more years to . "

I will take back the questions and we will now continue it. Part 3 Amelia delivers a brilliant response for the Q card question about a video game that she has played. Firstly, she does not use templates to start her response. She specifically tackles the question stating that she loves to play the game Call of Duty. She doesn't start by saying thank you for giving me the opportunity or there are lots of video games, but the one I'd like to talk about today, these kinds of template responses waste time and get lower band scores. In this case, Amelia gets straight to the point. She has structure, a beginning, a middle, and an end to her story, even though she makes one or two slight pronunciation mistakes, like saying strategy, which is more about German pronunciation for the word strategy. This is okay, band 9 doesn't mean it's perfect, it just means it's expert level. And certainly we can conclude that this is an expert level response. Notice when she comes to the end of her story, she uses a concluding sentence saying, I am sure that I will continue to play Call of Duty for many years to come. She gives specific details and no repetition throughout her entire response. This sets up a great foundation for her answers in Part 3.

This means that it should not just sound like like an awkward question and answer session where the information is separated. It should sound like a unified conversation. And in this case, Amelia does that by giving examples. Remember what I said that her part 2 answer is a great foundation for her part 3 ideas? In the first question, when asked about different types of video games, she gives several answers saying simulators and first person shooter games.

It's this smooth example that connects her ideas, which gives her that perfect band 9 score when asked about how video games might change in the future, again, she create. It's a strong connection with previous questions about the role of video games in education.

Which behaviors should be encouraged in current and future generations to reduce waste and safeguard the environment? How can this be done? Let's talk about nature's wisdom. If people continue to abuse the environment, what will be the consequences? What are the warning signs of such consequences that we can observe today? Some people believe that it is too late for people to reverse the damage already done to the planet. Do you agree with this? Why or why not? That is the end of part 3. And that concludes the speaking portion of the Outs exam. You will have your mark in about 10 days time with the other sections. Have a great rest of your day and do remember to take your passport with you. That is the end of part 3. And that concludes the speaking portion of the Outs exam.

So, I came up with the notion to, campaign around, my, block and ask my neighbors to join forces with me and create a, basically a group who would gather every Saturday morning for an hour or two and on designated routes, pick up all of the garbage that we see, sort the garbage into, different kinds of, recycling bins for papers, plastics, metals, and glass in order to make this idea become a reality. I needed to do the work, talk to the neighbors as well as organize a schedule. I use Google drive to coordinate all the people and then we submitted a proposal to our local municipality for some funding for the equipment. This idea worked out really well, and it's functioning to this day. The neighborhood is a lot cleaner as a result and we can see that, everybody's enjoying the surroundings, the parks are cleaner. I'm sure the plants are happier as well, and it might even be having a positive effect on tourism in our local area just because, because it's more pleasant to, stroll around in the parks and in the streets.

            },
            {
                "input": "Yeah, I think you did you did very, very well, I think you did very well. Was there anything that was different from the other two times that you did the test for real? ",
                "output": "Is, is very similar to the atmosphere you get on the real test. I don't think there's no difference in the only maybe the difference is cause, you know, you know, I know you and they examine them, maybe you don't know the person that's sitting next to you, but I've because I've been on the real test and usually they very, they're very welcoming. They never make you feel like, you know, in pressure stress though. "
            },
            {
                "input": "Yeah, normally they're they're like that not all of them, but norm normally they're, they're like, if you do get someone in your next in your next test, who's not very friendly, don't, don't, don't bother. You know, they might just be having a bad day, you know, so don't worry about it. And just to give the same performance. So you need a 6.5. And so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go through the test and then I'm gonna talk about the four marking criteria. I don't think there's any chance that you will get below a 6.5. But what I would like to do is to give you the confidence so that you feel confident on test day and you're not worrying too much about speaking because your main worry is writing. So I would, you know, if somebody is really worried about speaking and then they're also worried about writing, it can drain their their energy a little bit. So we wanna give you as much confidence as as part. It's a long day. Yeah, and speaking in a different language is tiring, you know, so, so, so let's talk about each part. So part 1, the part, the thing that I really liked about, your performance in part 1 was it was nearly exactly the same as when we were speaking before the test. So when I was speaking to you and your husband, you were speaking to me like you were a friend or a colleague in the same way that I would speak to Justin or to one of my friends, just in a nice relaxed way and Deb, you had no problem dealing with any of those questions. You gave full answers, you developed them. Well, your fluency was good, your coherence was good and we'll talk about grammar and vocabulary later. You're no problems with with pronunciation, but you had no issues at all. Sometimes when people two part 1, the first few questions, they're a little bit nervous, but I didn't sense that from you at all. You didn't really seem like you were nervous or you were worried about it. So I don't think I have, I would have any, worries for you. In part 1, one of the things that I noticed was we'll talk about grammar later in a second, but one of your areas of weakness when it comes to grammar is, verb tenses. For example, when I said, will you use social media in the future? You were using the progressive tense. The, you're talking using press hasn't continuous, to describe what you are doing in the future. You're saying I am using it less, one of the ways instead of using will or going to, for example, to talk about the future, one of the things that the examiner will do is they will ask you about the past, the present, the future. They'll ask you how often you do something, they'll ask you to compare things, what are your favorite things? So they're trying to get you to use different grammatical structures, like compare things, comparatives, what's your favorite things? Superlatives, how often do you do things? The past, the present, the future, different, verb tenses. And you can sometimes judge that by that the type of question that they ask you. So if they ask you about the future, you're going to use well or going to, or something like that future, structures that we would use to describe the future. If they're saying high, has your hometown changed? If you compare it to 20 years ago, you might be using present perfect or past simple. So that could help you, with your verb tenses by listening to what they're trying to get you to do in the test. So if they say, what did you do last weekend? Past simple. What do you normally do at the weekend? You're going to use present simple because you're talking about habit and things that you do. So you can you can tell what they're looking for. And that can help you in part one, but I don't think you have a major problem with tenses, but it's one of your, your weak areas. So just, I don't think you have a huge problem part one, but I'd like to help help you out as much as I can. Part 2 was very, very good. You had no problem speaking for the two minutes. The thing that the examiner is listening out for is, mostly fluency and coherence. So, were you able to speak without much effort for the full two minutes and you had no problem talking for the two minutes? And I think you could, you could have spoken for three or 4 or five minutes about that topic without much effort. There was some small hesitations and things like that. We'll talk about that later. But you'd no problem with, with part 2. So that was good. So based on on that, I don't think you'll have any problems with part 2, part 3, the one of the main things a examiner will be list listening out for and part 3 is development of your ideas. One of the problems that you have that we did dealt with today when we were working on a writing was answering the question, explaining why that answers the question using examples. And I think this is a good opportunity for you to kind of kill two birds with one stone by you could maybe practice part 3 questions and you can use the structure that we were talking about today for task 2 writing, which is answer the question, explain example, cause you were sometimes you were answering questions or you're like, I don't know, some people would think this and some people would think that and some people would think a third thing and some people would think without really developing it, and then sometimes you would answer the question, but your explanation might not have been as as cohesive and as coherent as as they would have liked. So I think that could be an area where you if you wanted to practice speaking, speaking part get some part 3 questions and kind of try and, answer them in by using that kind of format of like answer the question, explain why you think that or why it answers the question and then also use examples. So we were talking about, do you have to spend a lot of money to create a nice home? Well, why not talk about some of the things that you do in your home that don't maybe don't cost that much money? We were talking about how is an apartment better than living in a house? I don't know if you live in an apartment or a house, but that, you know, if you if you live in a house. What what do you like about living in a house? You know, talk about, well, at my house we have a garden and it's really nice to play with the kids in the garden and you know, because those things are very easy to talk about. And often people get to part 3 and they're like, oh, I just want this to be over. I've been talking for 15 minutes, so those little examples from your real life or, you know, my husband works in construction and he builds houses, and I've noticed that he's building a lot more apartments these days. So that that's probably an indication that in the future. But well, you know what? I'm, you know what I'm saying? I don't think you had a huge problem with part 3. But I think those are just some ways to make it easier for yourself, make your job easier, and then you'll have more energy and more focus and when we're doing, doing the writing. So, the last two times you did the speaking test, you got about 7. I can see why you got, you got such a high score pronunciation. I can understand everything that you say to get a 7 or above, the examiner will have to understand a high hundred percent of what you're saying. You've no problems with with pronunciation. We could talk about higher level pronunciation features, but for someone like you that needs a 6.5, it's overdoing it. We don't need to talk about intonation and sentence stress and connected speech and things like that because you don't really need to waste your time time on that because there are other things i.e. the writing test that we need to spend more time and in order to get a high score overall, we should spend most of our energy on things that need spend our energy on fixing our weaknesses and pronunciation is not a weakness for you. Your, your coherence is good. You answer the question that has been asked, you develop your answers some of them in part 3 could have been a bit of a bit more developed, but overall, your coherence is good. Your fluency is also very, very good. You do hesitate at times, but those hesitations are when you're trying to think of the next thing to talk about, you're trying to think of content, you're trying to think of ideas, you're not pausing and hesitating because you can't think of the correct word or the correct grammar. So you don't think you have any problems with, fluency. You have a nice range of vocabulary as well. Your vocabulary is very strong. One area that you could maybe work on a little bit is collocations. But again, someone who needs to 6.5, I wouldn't say to them, okay, you need to spend 6 months improving your vocabulary. You're improving your, your collocations because we don't need to do that. Your, your vocabulary is good enough to get AAA 6.5 overall. The main area of weakness when it comes to your speaking, it's not, it's not bad. I can under understand everything you're saying. And if you were making grammatical errors that stopped me understanding what you were saying, you could get a five for grammar, which would bring your whole score down, but you are making lots of little grammatical errors. So prepositions, especially articles, some verb tenses from time to time, countable, uncountable nouns, things that don't stop me understanding anything that you're saying and you're not making them that frequently, but they do pop up from time to time as. Specially prepositions. So that would be my only area of concern. But to get a 6.5, I don't think you need to go away and spend six months on a grammar course in order to get that 6.5 writing maybe a little bit different. We need to work a little bit more. And you make more mistakes when you're writing than you do speaking in terms of grammar. But if you really wanted to get to go beyond the band 7, let's say in a few years time, you wanna move to Canada or you wanna change your career, you want to become a doctor and you need a higher score, then we would, we would maybe have really focused on those weak areas of grammar, but I don't think we need to do that at the at the moment. So overall, I would be confident that you would get you probably would get a 7 again. You might get a 6.5 if you got a topic that you were notfamiliar with and you made you got nervous and you were making a few more grammatical errors and you were, that caused your fluency to drop, but I don't think you would drop below 6.5, for the reasons that that I said. So I think you're pretty safe, and well done. Do you have any questions? Thank you. So that, no, I think you should go into the test with a lot of confidence and, just speak to the examiner in the same way that you spoke to me like you were talking to a colleague, talking to a friend. I think you'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, so let's move on to writing. Do you have any questions? Thank you. So that, no, I think you should go into the test with a lot of confidence and, just speak to the examiner in the same way that you spoke to me like you were talking to a colleague, talking to a friend. I think you'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, so let's move on to writing. ",

It wasn't, it wasn't hard for me to learn, computer science on that one because, with the develop of the technology we got also a computer, internet connection in our house. So practically, I started to grow up, on the same time with the technology. So now, the main benefits that I'm getting from that, are, me knowing to use, and discover more utilities of the computer, new programs, I can manage to solve my own problems with the computer, hardware, also software. I also don't have any difficulties when it comes, to work to solve a problem with my system at work.

We had only one, 1, one room with computers and the rest were all old books. So every, new information that we got, it came from books and not an actual technology piece or I don't know, let's say we are studying biology.

So now I'm gonna give you some advice, and I'm basing this advice on the fact that you've done the test three times now you've got a band 6, the first time in speaking, then you got 7, and then you got 8, in speaking before, okay, so you're continually improving and what we want to do with you is to make sure that next time you do the test that you absolutely, 100% are going to get at least the score that you need cause as a pharmacist, you need a band 7, what you're struggling a little bit with writing at the minute, but sometimes students will focus so much on writing and let's say they're at a band 7 for speaking and they'll focus so much on on writing that they as they forget or, or they just are a little bit complacent when it comes to speaking. So what we're gonna, the advice I'm gonna give you now is to make sure that you would never fall below a 7 and to make sure that that you get there. Okay, so first of all I'm gonna go through each part and then I'm gonna go through the four marking criteria. So, you did something in part 1, which is very, very common where, were you were a little bit nervous at in the beginning. So when we're talking about work, you are a little bit more hesitant, shorter answers and that is totally normal. And the exam, most examiners will, will, will expect that, because part 1 is, is, is important, but it is designed to let you ease into the test and to let you warm up. So that's why they ask you questions about work, about your hometown, about your home, which, you know, it are, are quite easy questions to try and get you warmed up. And as you went through when you were talking about your hometown and more when you're talking about your childhood, you were talking far more fluently. You were developing your answers. It was, yeah, more relaxed. So the, when you're talking about work, it was like not robotic, but when you're talking about hometown and childhood is like talking to a friend about, so, if you and I were in a coffee shop and I was saying, you know what, what did you have a nice childhood? You're like, yeah, I did. And just talking naturally and that was great to see. So part 1 was, was really good. The examiners would never listen to your first few answers that were a little bit, let's say they were a little bit short flumency a little bit hesitant, they would never base their score on those first few answers. So some people watching now would be like, oh, she gave one short answer. She gets a band six, like that's not how the examiners think or how the marking criteria area thinks the examiner will base their score on the totality that, your total performance not on one short answer or one answer where you hesitated for example. So, for part 1 and the length was good. You really eased into it. Your fluency was excellent. Some nice vocabulary in there, some grammatical errors, but we'll talk about that when we talk about the four, marking Craig material. Part 2, I think part 2 was the, was the area that, you struggled with a little bit, compared to the other parts. Cause there's a lot of pausing, a lot of hesitation. So your fluency wasn't as good in part 2 as it was in part 1. And on part 3, I'll tell you why I think, but it's always good to hear from the student. Why did you think that you were struggling or did you didn't didn't do a bad job, by the way. It is just in comparison to the other parts you were. There was more audible pauses and like. Part 2, I think part 2 was the, was the area that, you struggled with a little bit, compared to the other parts. Cause there's a lot of pausing, a lot of hesitation. So your fluency wasn't as good in part 2 as it was in part 1. And on part 3, I'll tell you why I think, but it's always good to hear from the student. Why did you think that you were struggling or did you didn't didn't do a bad job, by the way. It is just in comparison to the other parts you were. There was more audible pauses and like. ",
                "output": "yeah. I've noticed that myself. Maybe because I tries to, I forgot about some ideas that I had in my head and I tried to see if I got all those, dots on the, on the card. I know I don't have to speak about all of them. They are just guidelines, but, I don't know. I didn't, I like at some point I felt stuck, I didn't know what to say, so maybe that's why with the long pauses. "
            },
            {
                "input": "So the audible pauses, are normal caused by one of two things, one is, linguistic or related to grammar, related to vocabulary. So you're trying to think of the correct word for example. The other one is related to ideas, people trying to think of content, basically things to say, was it linguistic where you're trying to think of the correct vocabulary and grammar or was it just ideas, ideas? Yeah, so the examiner will will also notice that, because if you are constantly stopping because you're trying to think of the correct verb tense or trying to think of the correct vocabulary, that's a signal to the examiner that, you have a problem with the English language if you're just pausing because you're just trying to think of the next thing to say, that's not really a problem with the English language. It's more of a problem with the subject and, and it's not. So the examiner should take that into account, but one of the things that I noticed that you did, which normally causes, a drop in fluency related to content is you listed a lot of things. So you're, you're like, so for example, it could be, I went to the shop when I got bananas and apple and cheese and cereal and then, and they're trying to think of the next thing and the next thing and the next thing. It's much easier just to pick one of those things. So you're talking about software versus hardware and go a little bit deeper into that and tell like a story related to that or example related to that. Because I think a lot of people go through part 2 and they're just like, okay, I need to talk about this. Let's list a lot of things about that. Then this list, a lot of things, this, and then you run out of time and run out of things to say. So I think in the, when you're doing the real test, don't be afraid to go very deep into one thing and especially pick one thing that you're comfortable talking about. Like, for example, I got, one nice little girl, I got Windows 2000 or something like that. And how are the changes that it made were blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I really learned a lot about programming through that. And so that's much better than we had Windows and we had Adobe and we had this and we had this and we had this. You see what I mean? And that that just makes it easier for you to be more fluent. And I, so I think that's the only in terms of fluency and coherence, that's the only area of concern that I would have. You weren't like, your fluency wasn't terrible. But we're just making sure that you would never go below a 7. And if you, that topic is sounds like something you know a lot about, but if you got another topic that you don't like, that could, that could turn into a problem for you. And it's part 2 is such a big part of the, of the test that if you get a topic you aren't comfortable with, plus you're trying to think of content that can really drag down your fluency scores. So, that, that would be my name be a bit of advice to go deep on a few things you feel comfortable talking about rather than trying to list everything, okay? And, examples and stories are, are, great. Like the story you told about when you're a little girl running after your auntie, you are very, very, very fluent because you're just talking naturally. It's much easier to talk about something you know about than to try and think of something completely abstract and to list lots of things. But overall, I thought, I thought it was good cause you got to the two minutes and that most people don't get to the two minutes and speaking in a foreign language for two minutes is not, is not easy. For part 3, I think you did really, really well. For part 3, you had no problems with any of the questions and a lot of the questions like for example, will AI replace teachers? Why are some people reducing their time on on their electronic, Those are difficult questions and the examiners will if they think that you are, you know, 7 or a band 8 or about 9, they'll ask you more and more difficult questions to see if they can stretch you and really test you. So if you get difficult questions, that's a good thing. Be happy if they ask you really simple questions like, you know, then you might have a problem, but you, you coped very, very well with those questions. I like the way that you answered the questions, gave an explanation, gave an example to help you fully answer, fully develop the question. So part 3 finisheded very, very strongly and in the test, don't be afraid to keep going in part 3 or you should keep going in part 3 because people often feel tired and they just want it to be over. So they get very short answers for part 3. Often people do that subconscious obviously as well cause I was like, oh I'm sick of this, but you did, you did a really good job on, on, on development. Development is the most important thing I think apart from the four marking criteria, development in part 3 is the most important thing. And you did a good job with that. So, well done. 4 marking criteria, your strongest area is pronunciation. Like many Romanian students, you're you, the clarity of what you're saying is very, very good. I can understand 100 percent of what you're saying, any IELTS examiner would be able to understand 100 percent of what you're saying. So that means that you would be getting at least a Bond 7 for pronunciation. Plus you have very good use of intonation, sentence stress, word stress, connected speech, all these higher level pronunciation features. You have a very good command of those, which means you would get more than a 7 for pronunciation. So when you combine, the examiner can understand everything. Plus you're using those higher level pronunciation features. So that's probably why you got a band 8 last time because you can't get a band 8 without using a higher level pronunciation features. For fluency and coherence, your coherence is very good because you answered every question properly. You stuck to the answering the question rather than going off topic. And you fully developed your question. So for part one, you don't need to give very, very long answers. You gave a few answers that were quite short at the beginning, but the rest were fine. Part 2, you talked for two minutes, so that was fine. And part of three, you fully developed your answers by answering the question, explaining, giving examples. So that was good to see. Fluency, was very good in part one, quite good in part 3, dropped a little bit in part 2, but we've already talked about that, that how, how to get around that. And I would encourage you to, don't be complacent about speaking and maybe practice part too. Yeah, cause part 2 seems to be the area that you need to, that the only area that you really need to worry about the subject. Yeah. Fluency, was very good in part one, quite good in part 3, dropped a little bit in part 2, but we've already talked about that, that how, how to get around that.

                "output": "it depends on your subject. So maybe I should do more subjects with various themes, Yeah, and have an answer about. "
            },
            {
                "input": "yeah, and some ideas. It's, you know, a pint of sweat is better than a drop of tears. You know, you know, you wanna, you wanna do your, the hard work, in, during your preparation, make it as difficult as possible. So the test day is a breeze and it's a, it's no big deal, for you. So that though that would be my only concern of fluent, your fluency is very good. It's at least, upon 7 level. But, you know, as I said before, if you got a topic that you know nothing about and they're gonna ask your bite the same topic in general in part 3. So it's like, you know, you said before you got, they're asking about history and you don't know anything about it, or you don't know very little about history. So that could cause fluency problems because you don't have a problem with the language, but you might have a problem with the content you're trying to think of of those things. But in general, it's very, it's rare. I don't think you would ever get a topic that, you know, nothing about. Like history is something that, you know a little bit about. You know, that what the First World War was and or the Second World War and you know, so you can you, they're not testing your, knowledge of the Second World War or the First World War. There's talking about whether you can talk about a range of topics. Your vocabulary, is quite good. You have a really nice range of vocabulary. I asked you about many different topics. You have no problem talking about all of those topics. So that because I was asking about a range of topics and you have topic specific vocabulary related to all of those you have, and that would indicate that you have a very, very wide ranging vocabulary because if you ask someone about 5 or six different topics and they have topics specific vocabulary, but all of those, that means that you could talk about pretty much any general topic. So that was very, very good collocations or something that I would that I would work on, for you, when you're listening to English and reading English notice collocations underlying them put them in a book and work, try and, practice them, review them and, and use them. That is collocations is one of the areas that tells an examiner the difference between somebody at a band 6, band 7 level and a band 8 band 9 level cause, if you listen to native English speakers, they will use collo collocations just intuitively without even thinking about it. Whereas, someone at a, at about 6.7 level will know the words. They might have a very wide ranging vocabulary, but they might not be able to put those words together, which is make may make a little, mistakes with that I'm not too worried about about your vocabulary though. I just be careful with collocations. But in the test, don't be thinking collocations. Collocations cause that will affect your fluency. Cause there's a balance between fluency and vocabulary and grammar. The more you think about vocabulary and grammar, normally, the lower your fluency, but, just be confident that that your, I think your vocabulary is good enough to get a band 7 at least. The one area that I would be concerned about is small grammatical errors. And you seem to have all, 2 things. One would be you seem to be, translating sometimes. So that's probably because of the way I would guess that you learned English through translation rather than learning it through, through, through, through, through, through commu communication. The other problem is little fossilized errors. Fossilized errors are errors that you make and you've no idea that you're making them so common. Fossilized errors are things like articles and prepositions. They don't affect, You didn't make article mistakes, by the way, but you made some proposition mistake mistakes and they don't affect communication. So if you're in Dublin and you're in a bar and you're talking to your boyfriend, he won't correct you. If you say of instead of in, you know, of the proposition because he understands exactly what you're saying. But so that means that you never pick up on the mistake that you're making and you make it again and again and again and again, and it becomes hardwired natural into your brain. A good way of, of getting around that is to record yourself and listen to you. So I think the best advice that I could give you would be get part 2 questions, look at them, prepare them for one minute, record on your phone, and then listen back, because that's going to help your fluency. It's going to help part 2, but it will also help you pick up on these little grammatical errors that you're making. You're not making any serious grammatical errors, and you're not making them like every single sentence, because if you were, there's no way that you would have gonna ban 7 on a band 8 the last two times that you did it. And I'm not really concerned that you'll get about 6 or about 6.5, but we wanna make absolutely 100 percent sure. These little errors that you're making with grammar are, also present in your writing. So I think working on them is going to help both your speaking and your writing. So we wanna make your preparation as efficient as possible.

He's a very good father and he always pays attention to spending quality time with his wife and especially his three children.

Also, when students study abroad, they have to show a certain level of English, this can be a grade 12 score of percent or grade B higher, and if they don't have this, then it needs to be an exam score score, such as a band 7 on IELTS and third, even when native English speakers want to get a job, working for an English as second language school, they have to show a high aptitude for the language. Many ESL schools these days require their teachers to have a band 8.5 or 9 on the IELTS exam. Now why does this candidate score a band 9? This candidate would score a band 9 because first of all his speech is natural. Of course, he's a native English American born user of the language. So his pronunciation, intonation, enunciation, word choice, use of expressions and idioms, as well as sentence structures are perfect. Secondly, he uses a great range of vocabulary. He has excellent lexical resource. Third, he has great comprehension and coherence, of course, he understands every question clearly, and he answers them accurately. He gives full answers, explanations, and often provides examples. His Part 2 response is complete with lots of detail and good structure.

You're very fluent, you know, there's no hesitation, you answered all the questions quite well with just a few exceptions. But yeah, strong point is definitely your fluency. But the other side, we need to work on the grammar, We know that you know that yourself. Yeah, like just, subject verb agreements sometimes like the basic ones, you know, we need to study them and be a little bit tight later, you know, for example, a common one that you were saying like I'm really like, blah, blah, blah. So I'm really like hot weather. So you know, yourself, I really like hot weather. Yeah, so make sure we have no no form of to be there. So I really like hot weather. Like for example, don't and doesn't they don't, he doesn't, these things need to be a little bit tighter here. What else do we got? If I have a free time, make sure there's no a there just free time. That's a common one. Other things we're looking at here, plurals as well. You are not adding the S to a lot of your, a lot of your sentences. You were saying like, for example, three times a week, three times a week. Yeah, sometime, sometimes I don't like game, I don't like games. Yeah, so plural would be one thing, you know, subject, verb would be another thing. So grammar needs to be a little bit tighter. Yeah, a little bit tighter. Vocab, any issues with vocab? One was like you said, pocketball, I know you use that word in Korean, I think in English it's better to say pull. Yeah, PO o L, yeah, so you can play Pooh with your friend. In other words, when you said small people, it shouldn't be small. What should it be? Yeah, a little bit tighter. Vocab, any issues with vocab?

And there was another one in part 1 as well when we were talking about, yeah, there's another one about social media. So just make sure the question was about, do you think you or your friends use it too much And you started talking about like children in general. So make sure and listen to the subject of the question. Also in, part 3, in part 3, many of your answers, you were talking about your situation, you know, part 3 should be more general, like people in your country.

So to estimate your score, estimates would be about 4.5 I would say today, to go through some I'll just go through a few errors that you made. I'll just point them out to you and then afterwards I will give you the paper with with with more. But I just wanna pick out maybe 5 or six different errors, okay? At the beginning when I asked you about your hometown and you said Sue on if you live there from 4 years old to 20. Yeah, just at the beginning you use the word since, okay, so you only use the word since with present perfect tense. So I've lived there since I was four, but you've lived there from from 4 to 20. So just use the past simple. Yeah, I lived in Suwon, from age 4 to 20 like that, and one time we said as well with, regarding preposition, you said, in there. So when you're naming the city, you can use in. Any preposition? Okay, just also some of your answers in part 1 were a little bit short. You know, I asked you, do you usually use your cell phone for calling or messaging? And you said, everyone uses cacao talk in so in Korea, so maybe you could explain Kakao Talk as it's a messaging app or a messenger app, but also just try to explain why, why you prefer messaging because it's more convenient. I can send a message anytime, you know, so just try to give a reason with that. Also I asked you about, do you have any plan to buy a new cell phone? So you said four months later I will buy an iPhone. So instead of four months later, it should be in four months. In four months when we talk about that, and also give a reason, you know, in four months, I will buy a new iPhone cause my old phone is slow, it's old, the screen is cracked, you know, any sort of reason would help, just give your answer a bit more length, you know, one question as well about losing something or finding something, what would you do? So let's try and like, let's try and really listen to the question and listen to the keywords. So there the keyword was wood, what would you do if you found something in your answer? I heard like I will so it should be. I would cause it's a second conditional sentence. I would give it to the police. Okay, let's move on to the part 2. So you said you spoke for like a minute and 40 wasn't too bad, but a lot of the time, I was hearing the present tense, you know, it's quite hard, it's quite meaningful, just make sure it's all past simple for the question. Yeah, and just to give a little bit of info about part 3 as well in part 3 I'm hearing like you said, for me, I like I like skiing and you said my father does a lot of overtime work, but just when you look at the third part, it's always about, people in general. Yeah, so like the question is, do you think people in your country have enough leisure time? Is leisure time important to everyone? So in part 3, you shouldn't relate it back to yourself, you should try to speak generally, but the, you know, people in your country, so you know, when you do the real exam, if you start answering about your personal experience, the examiner will change it back and make sure to talk about general topics. Just a couple of things as well about our prepositions. Most of people should always be most people. I think that's a quite a common mistake. Yeah, so most people in my country, yeah, and go to hiking, go to skiing, it should be just go hiking, go skiing. So with I N G, so I'll I'll give this to you after, but, those are just a few errors that maybe they're common and a lot of people make. Yeah, but, yeah, thank you for coming in, right? Thank you, cheers. Just a couple of things as well about our prepositions. Most of people should always be most people. I think that's a quite a common mistake.

I would estimate your score at probably 5.0 today. So I have a full list of some, some errors and some things we can improve on. I'll just pick out a few of them and I'll explain to you now. Okay, so yeah, first of all, we'll we'll go through your answers in part 1. Your answers in part 1, they were they were clear, but some of them were were very short. That was just one thing I noticed. For example, there was a question there, why do some people wear expensive watches? And you said that to appeal, they're rich, right? So that's obviously a little bit short for IELTS test. Yeah, so to appeal their, rich to change that one instead of appeal, I would say the better word there is flaunt flaunt is like show off. Yeah I'm gonna give this to you anyway, so you don't need to write down. So to flaunt their rich better word would be wealth. Wealth is a noun form, so people wanna flaunt their wealth, people wanna show off to others. Yeah, so again, so it needs to be just a little bit longer and part 1, try to give a reason for each answer. You said she makes me upset. So she made me. Yeah, she made me upset. So you could use used to. So she used to like, she used to make me upset regularly. Okay, one more thing here, watch a YouTube for YouTube, we don't need any article, watch YouTube, watch Netflix. You could say like watch a TV show on YouTube, that's a TV show on YouTube. Oh yeah, I like to, watch a movie on Netflix, that's fine. Yeah, and this one about your talent, you said I'm good at, making and good with your hands. Since since I was a child, yeah. I've been good at drawing Since I was a child. I've been good at sports since I was a child. Alright? And I asked you about your, your family members, do they have the same talent? And you said no I'm a precious person like precious means like really important, valuable. There's an idiom actually people use for that. People would say like I'm the black sheep of the family, you know? I'm kind of different to the others. Yeah, so possibly you could use that in that situation, whatever you see another few grammars, okay, a common one here and almost people very common error I come across so it should be most people, most people, most Korean people about that. Another one, it is less tired, so it is less tiring. So always for it, you say I n G, it is boring, it is exciting, it is tiring, so I am tired I'm bored, yeah, what are the things we're looking at plurals as well, sometimes I hear a lot of singular instead of plural, is it like small city? So when we're talking in part 3, we should say small cities. Another one, it is less tired, so it is less tiring. So always for it, you say I n G, it is boring, it is exciting, it is tiring, so I am tired I'm bored, yeah, what are the things we're looking at plurals as well, sometimes I hear a lot of singular instead of plural, is it like small city? So when we're talking in part 3, we should say small cities. ",

            {
                "input": "small cities don't have many facilities, large cities are very comfortable to live in, yeah, where is another one, okay, another common one here is every people so with every it should always be singular, so every person, every day, every city, okay, with our pronunciation, it's not too bad, it's pretty clear, but there's some L and, or when you say the word, for example, like recommend I would recommend you just try and make it a little bit harder or yeah, so we can practice that again, yeah, but yeah, it was a good test overall, in part 2 as well, the question is a city that you would recommend to live in not your hometown, I probably wouldn't call hongdae a city I'd call it a part of a city like you can say Seoul as the city cause Seoul is not your hometown, right? Yeah, so is fine and like you could also say, I recommend this area that that's also fine. Yeah, overall is a good test. There's a like few things we can improve making part 1 a little longer and like you can look at the grammar is here and make it a little bit tighter, but overall was good, it was good, thank you, thank you.

So here test is finisheded. So let's do a little bit of feedback for now. So I would estimate your score to be around 5.0. A lot of good things, all good things. Fluency is quite strong. You were able to speak most of the time there was little hesitation. Yeah, fluency for the level, your vocabulary was pretty appropriate. In terms of pronunciation, few things just maybe like the F sound when I'm hearing the word perfect per perfect with one or important, important and perfect, the F and PA little bit, super, it's a super woman Superman. I was kind of hearing like super rather than super. Yeah, so few little things with pronunciation, but pretty clear overall. Yeah, I think the thing that's gonna bring you down a little bit is the grammar, there are quite a few errors kind of coming coming through. I'm just going to pick out a few areas to look at and we can, we can fix them up. Let's look at one. Okay, and you said at the beginning too much lazy, lazy, too much noisy.

                "input": "okay. Alright, that'll do us for part 3. Okay, thank you, thank you. Alright, so yeah, let's start with the feedback for the test. So I think it was a, it was a good test. You're very clear at communication, you understood and answered all the questions very well, right? I would, I would probably estimate your score to be 5.5 today. Yeah, I'll bring you through some things that we could improve on. I'll I'll give you this after anyway, but I'll just point out a few little errors, right? So if you look at, part one of the test, we talked about traveling. I try to travel at least once a year. Yeah, one thing with your, preposition. You said I'm busy for studying. You should probably say I'm busy with, I'm busy with my studies. I'm busy with work. I'm busy with a lot of things these days. One common error here as well, I usually go travel in Korea. So I would say travel, or you can also say go on, like go on trips. I usually go on trips in Korea. I usually travel in Korea, right? One more thing, the question was, how do you feel when you're traveling? You said, I feel exciting. So when you say, I feel you should say EDI feel excited, I feel tired, I feel bored. You can say like when you talk about traveling, it is exciting, it's boring, it's, you know, whatever. And some of your answers in part when we're a little bit short, we're talking about chatting a loner in a group, try to give a little bit more reasons if you can also just to clarify, like chatting is not always like on the phone. So I think sometimes people are confused with that chatting is face to face as well. So the last question or the second last question was, do you prefer face to face or social media? So that was the only time we were talking about social media. Usually when people say chat, it means like talk, go to a cafe and chat with their friends. Yeah, okay, that was part one, part 2, it was good. You spoke for almost the full two minutes, it was nice. One thing, just be careful in, part 2 was your tense, most of the time you were speaking in present tense. So you were saying it makes me tired. It includes, we have to, he ignore all of them. So yeah, we had to, it included, it made us tired, he ignored all our messages. When you use the verb tell, there's no preposition here. So we told our teacher, with ask, tell, and call, contact these verbs. There is no preposition there. So like we asked him, we told him, we called him, alright, and part 3, part 3, like, yeah, again, you answered all the questions clearly there was a lot of repetition with, I think most answers began with, I think, I think so try and use some variety there. Like in my opinion, it's because, or I would say from my perspective, people are tired because of, so just variety is important there. One common error as well that I hear a lot. So you should usually say it depends on the plus singular noun. Yeah, so it depends on the day, it depends on the season, it depends on the job, yeah. So again, like really clear communication and really nice, just sometimes we need like little bit more, little bit, more expanded answers. Yeah I'll give you this. You can look at this as well. Yeah, so thanks for coming in. Thank you, thank you, thank you. So you should usually say it depends on the plus singular noun. Yeah, so it depends on the day, it depends on the season, it depends on the job, yeah.

                "input": "Hey, Chris here from IELTS Vantage. So about three weeks ago we released a video showing a real student, Rashmi from India doing a mock isle speaking test with me. And in three weeks it has nearly 400000 views. So obviously you guys love this type of interaction and the comments were that you love to see how I was able to help a student in real time and help them improve their speaking. So what we decided to do was bring Rashmi back into our office and do a brand new series of videos with her. And what we did was we split it into part 1, part 2, part 3. So we're going to have three videos and each part at the beginning I'm going to give Rashmi advice and feedback on how to do her best in each part part so you guys can watch that and learn from it yourselves, then see rashme's performance, and then I'm going to give her feedback on her performance, talk about her pronunciation, her grammar, her vocabulary, and her fluency and coherence. And without further ado, here it is. Okay, rashme, so what we're gonna do first is I'm gonna give you some advice on how to perform to your best in part 1. Alright, Okay, so we're gonna talk about part 1 itself first, some strategies, some techniques, and then we're going to talk about the four marking criteria. So that pronunciation, fluencing, coherence, gramma, grammatical range, and accuracy, we'll just call that grammar and lexical resource. We'll just call that vocabulary. Okay, Alright, so part 1, the best way to describe part 1 is just normal everyday small talk type questions. They're all questions about you, so you can't get them wrong. Don't try and think of like impressive ideas or anything like that, but just think of it as having a normal conversation with somebody. Let's say you and I were colleagues or classmates or something like that, and I was getting to know you. So I'm asking things about your hometown, where you live, your interests, your hobbies, just normal, getting to know you questions. Does that make sense? Yes, yeah. So like we talked about before, one of the things that students do in this part is give very, very short answers. So for example, where are you from? Mumbai or what's your job data analyst? And in a normal conversation, that would be fine, but because you're in an English test, the examiner needs enough data, enough information to judge your fluency, your pronunciation, and your grammar and your vocabulary. So try and develop your answers a little bit more. An easy way to do that for part 1 is just answer the question and then add a little bit more detail. So you could give an explanation or an example or a little bit more detail. So let me give you an example. If somebody asked me, what's your job, I wouldn't say teacher. I would say I'm a teacher and I specialize in teaching ails. Primarily. I do it online. I have a company, you know, a little bit more information that I, and it will also allow you to develop more complex sentences as if you say things like, hello, my name is Chris, that's a very simple sentence, but if you add a little bit more detail or an explanation or an example, it makes the sentence a little bit more complex. And for someone like you who is aiming for the band aids the band minds, that's what you would need to do. And so any questions about part 1. So let me give you an example. If somebody asked me, what's your job, I wouldn't say teacher. I would say I'm a teacher and I specialize in teaching ails. Primarily. I do it online. I have a company, you know, a little bit more information that I, and it will also allow you to develop more complex sentences as if you say things like, hello, my name is Chris, that's a very simple sentence, but if you add a little bit more detail or an explanation or an example, it makes the sentence a little bit more complex. And for someone like you who is aiming for the band aids the band minds, that's what you would need to do. And so any questions about part 1. ",
                "output": "no. "
            },
            {
                "input": "all good. Okay, I think the main criticism. Last time for part 1 was just shorter answers. So try and the other thing is not too long either. I know that's frustrating advice, like not too short, not too long. The thing is if you, the examiner has to ask you a range of different questions and they only have four or five minutes to do that. So if you talk and talk and talk and talk, the examiner will keep stopping you. And then often students can feel like, oh, what did I do? I'm doing something wrong. And they'll get stressed out, and that can affect their fluency. So I don't like to give students like number of sentence or number of words, so just follow the rule, answer the questions a little bit more detail, you know, two or three sentences maximum. If you're going over like 4 or five sentences, probably too much, but don't, but don't be thinking counting words or counting number of sentences or anything like that. Okay? So, for fluency, last time your fluency was great. There was a few ums and as, and likes and oh, and fillers like that. But good fluency is not about never, or, you know, none of those little, the audible pauses. If you listen to the greatest speakers of all time, they all pause and have little audible pauses and that is not what good fluencies are about. Good fluency is just speaking at a normal pace with, I don't know, natural number of pauses or hesitations. And you do pause and hesitate. But naturally, like everybody else when I'm speaking, when, you know, when anybody in the world is speaking, you pause cause you need to, you need to think, to your fluency. No big, no big problems there. Coherence, you do answer the questions, but sometimes they're a little bit too short, especially for part 1. We've already talked about that. For pronunciation, you're like intonation, your sentence stress, your connected speech is already really good. Your clarity is also good. One thing though, you're, you're a shy girl, I know you, you're a little bit timid sometimes when people, not that there's anything wrong with being shy, you know, I was shy when I was your age too. People who are, are shy tend to speak on a low level, the volume, it can be a little bit low, they don't enunciate their words as clearly, so you could improve your pronunciation by pretend you're speaking to me, you know, when I'm standing a little bit further across the room and speak from your, your diaphragm, not from inside. So a lot of people speak from inside their mouth, whereas people who enunciate very well speak from their, their diaphragm, their stomach. So if you try and don't shout it, okay, but, but pronunciation is really good for you, so you don't I'm just, just a little tweak, it's not, not no big deal. Grammar, your grammar is incredibly accurate, very, very accurate, a nice wide range. And I think that by extending and developing your answers a little bit, you will add complexity to your sentences as well. So we don't need to worry about that your, vocabulary is also very, very good. However I think to push on to the next level during your preparation, like this is preparation. This is not the real test. You could try and take a few more chances, not trying to use like fancy vocabulary, but the best way to improve your vocabulary, I think, is to think of more topic specific words. So if we were talking about data analysis, there are certain words that we would use, such as you tell me some words that you know more about data analysis than I do, analytics, AI artificial intelligence, you would only use those words really when you're talking about that topic. So when we're talking about these topics, try and think of some topic specific words, but be careful you, it can also affect your fluency if you're trying to think of big words. So you're like, I want to think of this word, and then it affects your fluency. So only if it comes naturally, you don't want to be sitting there thinking, what big word will I use? But I think try and, I improve it a little bit, does that sound good? Yeah, good. Do you wanna start? Yes, okay, okay, so first rush me, do you work or do you study? Yeah, good. Do you wanna start? Yes, okay, okay, so first rush me, do you work or do you study? ",

It's just lying around in the database. So, now companies are starting to use that data to analyze it and look at trends, past and future trends, which is, falls in the predictive analytics category. So I'm very much interested in, looking at both, the behavior of data and the consumer behavior, which the data tells you. So the analytics, lets me, study that and look at, the data in terms of how you can manage your customers, better. So I want to learn, and I guess it's because of that. "

            {
                "input": "well, we'll, well, let's talk about the differences. The main difference was you developed your answers much, much more. So that would have helped your coherence would have helped your fluency, would have helped your, your grammatical range as well. So you did a, you did a really, really good job there. There was only one where you talked, quite a, quite a long time. But you only did it for 1, 1, 1 answer. The examiner would probably only stop you if you did that for every single answer because they need to ask you a range of different questions. So you did, really, really well in terms of coherence. You answered every question. Everything that you said was related to the question. So you did a very, very good job. Grammar, again, extremely accurate, wide ranging, it used a range of different tenses and structures, and your, your, sentences were more complex that time because you're adding in more clauses because you were adding in more detail and explanations and examples and just elaborating a lot more on, on the answers. In terms of vocabulary, you did, you did an excellent job. I think that you used even more topic specific vocabulary and you tried to push yourself a lot more, and a, and again, the most important thing is accuracy and your vocabulary is extremely accurate. So you did a very, very good job there. With pronunciation. Again, the intonation was great. The, sentence stress connected speech already good. I could understand 100 percent of what you were saying, you did try and enunciate a lot more, the people watching might say, I didn't hear this or hear that because it's the microphone and because of the sound and they're less wa watching on their little iPhone or whatever. But in the, in the studio here, I can understand everything that you're saying, which is great. One of the things that, was brought up in the comments before was that you have a tendency to say like, which is, there's a lot of different ways that you can use the word, like the primary way that you use the word like is to, is for examples. So when you're writing an essay, you would write, for example, for instance, that's a more formal academic way, or such as, but when you're speaking, if you listen to how people from this part of the world, say, give examples instead of saying, for example, they'll say like, which is totally normal. It's not a, you're, you're not using it as a filler. You're using it to exemplify things, to use it as example. So that was totally fine. And one of the questions you I asked you about a color that you dislike and you said red, and you were talking about an emotional thing, something traumatic that happened to you. So anyone watching, I've had this happen to me, in during the test where someone you ask a question that is quite innocent and the person thinks of some horrible event that happened in the past and then they start to think about that event and they start to get very nervous and stressed out and emotional and that can affect the performance. So anybody watching, I would avoid talking about traumatic things like I've I've, and yeah, it's totally natural. It just pops into your mind. Like the very first lesson I ever taught I asked this lady about, her family and she was AI didn't know, but she was a refugee and her whole family had died. And I was like, oh my God, you know, you just, and she kind of fell apart and she, cause you all, obviously, it was a traumatic thing for to talk about. So if it happens and if you're watching this video, avoid emotional traumatic things. And because it can put you off, you know, but you did an excellent job. Very, any questions about part 1? Very, any questions about part 1? ",

So a good example would be if I came home late and I said, hi, honey, to my wife, how are you? And she said, fine, fine. Like with a rising intonation, that means she's fine. But if my wife said fine with a downward in today, that means it's not fine. Or if I, or if a student came into the classroom and they were late and I said, please sit down, please sit down. So going up and then down, that would mean that I'm totally fine. And it's a polite way to ask him to sit down. But if I said, please, it done, please, it done sounds very serious. So because it's just, there's just a falling intonation and, but you have very natural intonation. It's very difficult to learn, for a nonnative English speaker. So you're doing a good job with that.

And so unlike the basketball and soccer, like a, which only requires their like a shoes and the ball, like there are certain type of sports, like which requires a lows amount of equipment, such as like not only a hockey, but like AI both lay and the sledge and. So thus like AI think, I think like depending on like what they use like that, that's just like a different first the expenses because like for instance, like for the horse riding, like they just need to like, take the care of the horse first of all, which is very important. And secondly, like they just need to like a train, like a horse rider, like every single day, like a four him or her to tame the horse like a well, like a for them to like actually for the participate in the competition. So it requires a lot of, budget, first of all, and secondly, it requires the, just like I mentioned, like if it takes time like to train in the horse, like in a certain period.

So, so far formal, it was like a prom, but kind of for like college students, so it was like a SCC, so student act activities committee, I think that's what it was called, so it was a, it was an event, organized by them.

So, so of course it had to be a suit. So it ended up being a suit, obviously, but the suit was in all black. So, so the shirt was black. The, the slacks that was also black and the jacket was black, but I didn't wear a tie. So, she were, she wore, she wore a dress in all white and I wore a suit and all black. So, so what else? I can remember a lot of details about the about the event itself, but, about the suit.

It was mostly very good and there was a good range of a good range of phrases and constructions. The only one thing, and this is really small, is that you might overuse the definite article. So the definite article is the, yeah, articles are very hard coming from Korean. Of course, there aren't any in Korean and there are articles in English. But a few times you've referred to, you know, cooking the garlic pasta, living in the soul, referred to something as the bedtown and the communication with family. I think those were four instances where actually you wouldn't need to use an article there because the pasta would just be a general like garlic pasta. It's just, yeah, it's not one specific one. There is only one soul, so it's not the soul versus another soul, it's just a soul. In a bed town, you would probably describe it as a bedtown in bed town, a bedtown because there are actually many bedtowns, okay, so slight overuse of the definite article, but that's a really, really small, small thing.

So you should keep it like generally speaking rather than your spec specific story. Alright, grammar like there's not, not much to say really, during free time, I would say like in my free time or when I have some free time, birthday preposition should be like on, on my birthday or when it is my birthday either.

Yeah, in his 50s. 1 verb was influenced so you can say just he influenced Korean people or he had an influence on Korean people. Those are two things. So the rest of it's really good.

Describe a day when you thought the weather was perfect where we, I was in Dubai a couple of months ago, just when the summer was about to end, there was this day when I was just standing in my balcony. It was a bit cloudy that day. And then like few minutes later, I saw the lightning and the thunderstorm and it just caught darker. And then we, I was standing in my balcony and I saw the lightning and I have the whole view of Dubai skyline. So I could see the Birch Khalifa, the Dubai frame, and I saw the lightning on top of right on top of which is beautiful. I recorded it, and I posted on Instagram, And then I saw a lot of people were posting the same stories, but from different places. A friend of mine came over. We had a glass of wine on the balcony and then it started to rain, like heavily in heavily so thunderstorm, rain, and it just not very common to see that in Dubai. That's why I thought the weather was perfect because it's always hot and sunny and humid. And as soon as like the season starts to change, I think they do something called cloud seating where, then they make it rain apparently. So it was very beautiful to see the rain. We had a nice day, nice evening in the balcony, having glass of wine, looking at the beautiful weather. The traffic was very crazy by the way. The roads were flooded. And I think like a lot of the audits and food, by the way, and it took us two hours to get the food to deliveries. "

But where I grew up, it's not very hot to some parts, especially the north. It's not very hot actually, Like throughout the year, the temperature I'd say would go up to twentytwo degrees, but we're in like down from deadly onwards. It gets really hot and humid and it's just because a lot of people use public transportation and it's not easy to use public transportation or walk around because when it's just so hot.

Okay, that one was great and you developed your answers enough and it was like talking to a friend or talking to a colleague and you could tell that you were a little bit nervous and about those nerves didn't really, in part 1 anyway, didn't really prevent you from from doing well. And you were, you know, answering the questions naturally, your nervousness didn't cause any problems with fluency on test day, you might be even more nervous. So a lot of my advice to you will be about kind of preventing nerves taking over the way I always describe it is our brain is kind of like a computer and stress is, is like putting too much, opening too many programs on your computer. Like you might have a great MacBook Pro, but if you put it under stress, everything kind of slows down. And that's this, I think the same with you. You've got a MacBook Pro up there for first speaking English, but you're, you're putting a little bit too much pressure on yourself. So the enemy is really yourself, if that makes sense. And you're more than capable of doing well. And what I would always say is I know it's difficult because you're speaking to an examiner you've never met before, but imagine a friend, imagine someone you're close with and they're, they're just asking you these questions. Imagine you're in a coffee shop in your, your local area having a coffee. Maybe if they ask you some of these questions, like what, why are you asking me that? But just that sort of of frame of mind that attitude and that often does does help students. The other thing to know is like, I would not lie to you. I'm telling you that you are very, very good. You are more than capable. So you should have confidence in your in yourself. Part 2, was good. Also there was a little bit of repetition halfway through, you were like, yeah, my friend came around and had a glass of wine and that would be a problem if you constantly did that. So if you say Ed, something like there was lightning, my friend came round, we had a glass of wine, we put it on Instagram. Yeah, there was lightning that day and you know what, my friend came around, you didn't do that, you just repeated one little bit, the reason you did that, I think I might be wrong, is you were trying to think of more things and you wanted to keep talking while was that correct? Yeah, that's okay. So the examiner will recognize that and probably won't mark you down for that. They would only mark you down if you did that a lot cause there's four bullet points, what a lot of students do is they will talk about the bullet points before or, or maybe some other things for a minute and then they'll just go back and they'll rehash them. They'll just repeat them. You didn't do that. But again, on test day, if you get nervous, it's kind of like a defensive thing to do is like look at the bullet points again. Oh I'll I'm just gonna talk about those things. So a good tip is to, add maybe three or four or more bullet points. Common things like how you felt past, present, future examples, stories, things related to that topic. And then when you start to think, oh I'm running out of things to say, just look down, talk about that and then talk about that. So just give yourself enough ammunition, to use part 3. You did, you did very well. In part 3, the examiner will ask you more difficult questions. The worst thing you can do is when you get a difficult question is just, and a lot of people just laugh and go. I've no, I don't know, you didn't do that even though you did get one question that you didn't know a huge amount about, you did very well because you attempted an answer. If you attempt an answer, what you're saying to the examiner is, I don't know about this topic specifically, but my, there's nothing wrong with my English. Remember, it's an English test, it's not a knowledge test, it's not an IQ test, but band 9 is the top mark. I think you're, you could be capable of getting a bound 9, but let's see whether you would actually get a bound 9. The first thing is pronunciation. The examiner will be thinking about 2 things, clarity, can they understand all the words that that you're saying and then higher level pronunciation features or we'll talk about clarity first. You're from India, and there's nothing wrong with having an Indian accent, a Vietnamese accent, an Irish accent. There's nothing wrong with any of those things, but a lot of the Indian students that we work with are worried about their, they're accent being too strong. Okay, I don't think that there's a problem with having a strong accent and any accent, but I think what they're saying is that their accent causes problems for the listener with with certain words. That is not an issue for you at all. There's not a single word that I couldn't understand. You still have your, your Indian accent and that's a great thing. You should be very proud of it. Yeah, there aren't extra marks for signing British or sounding American. I'm sure that, you know, lots of Indian celebrities that have an Indian accent but speak English very, very clearly. Shopper for example, like she speaks with an Indian accent, but you can understand every word that's the same, the same with you. So you're doing very, very well there. One thing about being nervous and being stressed is that, people can sometimes speak kind of inside their mouth. Yeah, and speak at the back of their throat because it's just a, it's a subconscious thing where we don't want to be criticized. We were afraid of saying something wrong. So we gonna speak inside our own mouth. I used to do it when I was a child. My little 9 year old boy does it all the time. It's about confidence, you know, you didn't do that, but I could see that, if you were really under pressure and you were very like, let's say you had a visa deadline. Yeah, and you must get this and you know, everyone's expecting you. You could go into the test and speak inside your mouth. That could affect clarity. I could drop your score a little bit. It didn't happen this time. My best advice would be, imagine you are speaking to the examiner and they are sitting against that wall and pointing 10 feet away. Alright, so we're about 6 feet away. Double that. Okay, alright, don't, don't be afraid of like I'm speaking quite loud to you at the minute. Don't be afraid of cause you seem, you seem the type of person that, maybe thinks speaking loudly at someone is rude and some, I don't know, some different cultures like that. Is that the case in India or . Okay, alright, don't, don't be afraid of like I'm speaking quite loud to you at the minute. Don't be afraid of cause you seem, you seem the type of person that, maybe thinks speaking loudly at someone is rude and some, I don't know, some different cultures like that. Is that the case in India or . ",
                "output": "yeah, it is. "
            },
            {
                "input": "I think I'm Irish, so we don't care. And how loudly we, you know, if you go to an Irish pub, you'll, you'll see you, you'll hear how high the volume that picks. Most people speak up the volume a bit again, pretend that they're 10 feet away instead of 6 feet away. You also, use higher level pronunciation features quite well. Intonation. So the intonation is when our voice goes up and our voice goes, darn, if I come home late and my, what I said, my wife says, fine, that's not, that doesn't mean fine, you know, so we use intonation to convey meaning. So fine, fine, the same word, two completely different meanings, 1 I'm in trouble when everything is actually fine. When people are nervous, they tend to have quite flat intonation. You didn't do that, but, on test day, just be aware of that. A good tip is to before the test, record yourself speaking and listen to your intonation. If I listen to you speak to your friends, your intonation would be more extreme I think cause hey, hey, how's it going? You know, and more when people are in a test and they're nervous and they're formal, they tend to speak more like this and very, very formal. It is not a formal test. And you might get an examiner who is very friendly. Yeah, sometimes you don't, sometimes they had a, you know, everybody has a bad day and their intonation might be quite flat and form formal and robotic. And people often, mirror other people, especially when there's a par dynamic, like someone seems more powerful because they're an examiner. Some students go in and they're great intonation outside the, the test and then they go into the test and their intonation, their speech patterns are a little bit rigid and formal and robotic. That wasn't the case, I don't think with you a little bit maybe, but not, not a big deal. Okay, next is, coherence and fluency. Coherence is, did you answer the question? It's like, if I asked you to talk about when the weather was perfect, did you actually mention a day when the weather was perfect? And you did all the questions. You actually answered them and you developed them enough. Even some of the questions in part 3 that you had difficulty with and you developed them enough and that that was absolutely fine of no problems with that at all. Your fluency. The only time when you had an issue with fluency was in the middle of part two when you were in a reformulating things and you were repeating things to try and think of other things. That is fine. And because you only did it once in part 2, it's not like they focus in, oh, you paused one time or you repeated something one time, they will listen to the whole thing and base the score on the whole thing. And you did an excellent job overall. You did pause at sometimes in part 3 when you were trying to think, but that had nothing to do with your language ability. Some people pause, when they're trying to think of the correct, what's the correct adjective or what's the correct verb to use and what's the tense to use? You didn't do that. It was only really about ideas. And again, that's related to stress and nervousness because people think that the examiner wants the best idea or the correct the idea. Remember, it's a speaking test. There are no extra marks for great ideas. You could be the leading expert in the world on O on weather and weather forecasting, or you could know nothing about it. It doesn't matter. All that matters is your pronunciation, your fluency, your grammar, and your vocabulary. So just do what you did. And if you get an unusual topic or a topic you're not comfortable with, do what you did, which is attempt it. But explaining, like, I don't really know much about this, and again, just don't put too much pressure on yourself thinking I need to give the world's greatest answer. You don't for a grammar. So there, there's two things the examiner will think about. One is rain change of your grammar, do you have enough grammar? So if I ask you about the past, do you know how to use past simple present, perfect, if I ask you about things to do in the future, do you have future structures? Do you know how to use comparatives and all, and, superlatives and all of these different grammar structures, everything that I threw at you were able to cope with that. So I don't think there's any problem with your range of, of grammar at all. The second thing that the examiner will think about is the, your, your accuracy. Overall, your accuracy is very good. There's no systematic errors. What a systematic error is every time you use that part, part of grammar, such as articles or prepositions, every time or nearly every time you use it, you make a mistake. That means that that system, that part of the grammar, you don't know how to use that yet. You don't have that, but you do have little slips every now and again. And those are, are not a huge problem. So for example, do you have these errors? Most of the time you, use prepositions correctly, but sometimes you have little slips. So most of the time you use articles, you use them correctly, but sometimes you make little slips, but they're quite rare and they don't stop me understanding what you're saying. So if you said to me, my friend and I went to a cinema instead of my friend and I went to the cinema, that doesn't stop me understanding that you and your friend went to a cinema. So, so for grammar, you would get a very high score. But on test day, if you're nervous and that MacBook Pro starts having too much pressure on it, just like a computer, we make more mistakes when we're nervous than when we're stressed out. So there's nothing wrong with your grammar. Again, the biggest enemy is really yourself, the more pressure you put on yourself, yeah, the more mistakes that you will make. Vocabulary. So there's two things at the Examiner, we'll think about accuracy. Are you using words accurately to describe things and you knows verbs, adjectives are, are those actually accurate? The words that you're using, you've no problem with accuracy at all. And then the second thing is range when I ask you about whether do you have enough weather vocabulary to do that? When I ask you about, we were talking about high school and education, do you have enough vocabulary? You do, but I think that you play it safe a little bit. So the weather was nice is are there other ways that you could describe the weather that is not inaccurate? There's nothing wrong with that, but in a speaking test, you are capable of showing off your vocabulary more. Now, for the vast majority of people, I would say the opposite. Especially people from India tend to show off and add in these crazy big, long, amazing words and they think that will boost their score. You have the opposite problem, which I think that, which is quite rare, is you're capable of using more vocabulary, but you play it quite safe. And it all depends on what score you want. If you want the absolute top score, you don't have to every sentence be throwing in a big complicated word, but you just have to, you know, every now and again throw in something a little bit more advanced and that would really, really help you. Am I correct in that you are capable of doing that or you are, yeah, up to you what you wanna do, but I that that would be my advice. So for, pronunciation if you were nervous and you were speaking inside your mouth, you would get pro on test day, you would probably get a band 8, but I think that you are capable of a band 9. I think today you were a band 9, which is the top score fluency on test day if you were repeating things a little bit and you're searching for ideas and you're putting too much pressure on yourself, you possibly could get a band 8. I think you're capable of getting a band 9 today. I think that you were a band 9, which is the top score. What it says for grammar is that even a band 9 student can make slips. I think that today you probably would get a band 9 on test day if you're nervous and you make them a wee, but more regularly you would get a band 8 vocabulary. I think today you were about 8 because you all of your stuff is accurate. But you're playing it too safe. Today. You would get a very, very high score, but in our next test I'll be expecting an E, an even higher score cause I think you can do way better than than you're you're currently showing. What do you think about that? Any questions or anything? No entrance? Any questions or anything? No entrance? ",

So I had to ship it early and then do some, fixing myself, how I felt about the experience was that, I was at first very nervous that I might not have, a good dress for problem, basically. And then afterwards, I felt that I could, make some changes myself and that I didn't need to just stick to what the shopping malls had for me.

Well, the shop might have like a complaint service themselves, where they can like write, like a short comment on their website or something that it's to their superior. Otherwise there might be, out of store review system where you can share your opinion with other customers, who might think about going there. But maybe you don't wanna encourage that as much. The biggest difference might be that you can't try those clothes on. I think the camera technology has evolved very much so that you can kind of feel the texture through screen. I think that kind of problem has been, less of for a couple of years. But I think still being able to try it on your self and see how it fits is kind of like the, biggest crucial, thing that kind of divides the shopping styles. "

We still I. We still want to try on kind of like the most expensive clothes before making that large marches. And I think there is that extra bit of kind of care you can get from like in person meetings. Like, sorry, when you go to a tailor to get your suit. I think that kind of thing can only happen in person. So maybe they'd, fade out like overall. But I think some of the most premium stores would remain regardless of how much, technology gets better.

So I think the response would be also similar to what you would do in an offline shopping mall. You can post complaints to, their superiors or like a representative kind of board of that shopping company. Or, you can share your opinions with other customers. I think that's much easier for online shopping malls because they, they require like a review section so that people can have more trust in their products.

Yeah, just make sure and always give a reason for your answer. And I know science is not really your thing. You can say that. That's fine. Like you can say, I don't really like science, but just the examiner will continue giving you science questions. So don't be surprised if you say I don't like science and they come back and keep asking you as normal, but just always explain, give reasons why. Yeah, reasons why empire 1, And terms of like grammar error is very few, right? Maybe one time you said about your prom dress, I had to ship it early instead of ship it. I'd say like get it shipped using like the passive voice. I had to get it shipped early because the company are the ones shipping it. Yeah, you said as well in part 3 in an offline shopping mall, I would say like just in a shopping mall, I don't think you need to use the word offline. Ya, ya. Thank you. Ya, ya. Thank you. ",

So yeah, when you receive money, especially in Korea, I feel like it's a custom to reject it at first, say no, I don't want it, but then your hand just goes forward and guess it. So, and then you say thank you afterwards. Are you to use money? Like I said, on choose aux or whenever I end entered a new school. So when I went from elementary school to middle school to high school and to college, and the people that gave me money were usually my extended family. So not my direct parents or my brother won't give me money for sure, but my grandparents made my aunt, my uncle, and those people are the ones that giving me money. And the reason why they gave me money was, it means it's just to celebrate a new, a new step in my life, I guess. And I used the money when I was young, mostly by buying Lego pieces or buying snacks at the local grocery store. But nowadays I choose to save some money so that I can buy something big later on, like a car or maybe in your computer. "

So it's not a really like an official thing, but when you go to traditional markets in Korea, they really accept accept card, so you have to pay in cash. And sometimes when they give you a discount, like maybe on a clothes, on clothes, or maybe on some kind of fancy luxury goods, they give you a discount when you're paying cash.

And because maybe as children, they might find it more enjoyable to cut off paper money rather than you actually use it. So I guess the time when people, children really start to comprehend the idea of money and the value of it is at least when they go to elementary school, when they start receiving some professional, education. And then your, when their parents start spending money under education, like on hog ones, I think that's when this really start to comprehend. "

They have to, they have full responsibility over their children and they have the responsibility to, among other things, tell people, tell other children to comprehend the idea of money.

Because money can literally buy anything. But what I find among my, a lot of my, not really my friends, but people in my previous school or other people I see in my community is that when they start receiving money, especially huge sums of money, starting young age, then they really don't know how to use it, effectively. So they would end up just splurging it on a computer, on a Nintendo Switch, and they really don't know how to use money efficiently.

We could say this, I would definitely want to get an ipad. Just make sure explain with a clear reasons why you like it. One time you said, why not give it a try? It's good expression, nice expression, but I think I would explain, reasons why it would be fun to do this. I think the question was like, do you wanna work in social media in the future?

Just the question was, describe a time, when you received money as a gift. So focus on more like one time, right?

This gives us a clear sense of the size of the house that she lives in. Also, when asked about work and play, how often does she work? She uses natural English by saying that she works quite a bit, but how much is that really for the listener? That's not yet clear because it's just qualitative. So she continues to explain that she works Monday to Friday from 9 AM until 6 PM, These numbers and days of the week clearly quantify what juliel means when she says I work quite a bit.

Basically, my idea is to bring together fashion designers on a YouTube channel and the designers that, get most likes been prices. Ultimately with the growing popularity of my channel and some of the designers, big brand names are like Gucci or Calvin Klein can contribute some sponsorship deals. Also I can sell the merchandise of, the fashion designers that participating in my project. I think in order to make my idea real, I need to come up with a clever name for my YouTube channel as well as I need to convince some ambitious designers. I think about this idea just because I think that there are a lot of fashion designers out there who have trouble getting recognized, and this could be a great way for them to gain some exposure. And also the viewers can get the excitement from the competition. I think once I'm in my fashion school in London, there will be more opportunities for me to do much of this just because there will be a lot of likely minded people there and this project start making money.

She uses a broad range of vocabulary like consumerism, and she is able to bring about logical answers for her explanations.

As I had mentioned in the first part of this interview that I really like to cook. So I think this would be a great way to share my passion with other people who, while giving them much needed sustenance, I would make some delicious cuddy buddy with litty with my special nonbread. I would love to host this event at a large community hall like the one that's a few kilometers away from my home as it can sit a couple of hundred people. I think the best time to organize this event would be in a summer when there is often less food from drought and even more people are in a difficult situation. I would not only invite hungry and impoverished citizens in my neighborhood, but I would also invite some volunteers to help me with the event. Also, I need some chefs and also some people to help me serve the food and clean up after. Also, I need some local journalists and some local authorities in the hopes of inspiring some more for similar events in the near future and maybe getting some ongoing funding as well. I think this event would be helpful in many ways beyond feeding only hungry and impoverished children and adults. This could be helpful in creating a sense of a community spirit and really bringing people together. "

Emma gives the best answers for a Band 9 because she meets the expert level of English on all four criteria of the speaking, interview, fluency and coherence, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy, and pronunciation. According to the IELTS, a band 9 fluency and coherence is when a candidate speaks fluently without pausing or only pausing slightly to think about information for the content and not for vocabulary and grammar. Amma does a fantastic job of this. She speaks continuously with good pacing and speed, nice intonation, and she takes pauses just a couple of times to think about what she's going to say, like in part 2, where she pauses to look at her notes to remind herself of her ideas. That's absolutely okay, and that's a good idea. Also, she speaks with appropriate, cohesive features. This means that she connects her ideas, she uses the English language naturally with correlation, saying therefore as a result, if when she uses correlative conjunctions, like not only, but also both, and whether or neither, nor her ideas are connected strongly and create a holistic picture or concept in the mind of the listener, also her answers are appropriate and fully developed. That's because she often gives an answer, explanation, and an example to the questions being asked. This creates clear understanding and good visual imagery in the mind of the examiner. Amba does a fantastic job giving these best answers. Let's talk a bit more about lexical resource. According to IELTS Ben 9, lexical resource is when a candidate can use a broad range of vocabulary with precision, regardless of the topic, being able to choose the exact correct word to express an idea clearly for that topic. Alma does an incredible job giving great answers. Notice all of the vocabulary that she uses in Part 2 when talking about out the charitable event. She's able to dynamically and accurately express herself as well. For IELTS Ben 9, you need to produce idiomatic language that is natural that you would hear a native English speaker use. Naturally in content. This means that you can't force idioms into a situation. I often hear students using idioms like I was over the moon or to hit two birds with one stone, but it doesn't really make sense in the con context. It feels forced. In order to use idioms naturally, you have to learn lots of them and only use them when they are appropriate. Amma does just that. Now, idiomatic language doesn't necessarily mean that you have to use these very complicated idioms, like don't throw bricks when you live in a glass house. They can be simple. They can be phrasal verbs. Like I came across, my friend at the shopping mall, came across is a phrasal verb that means to encounter, to meet someone by accident. So when you're thinking natural, idiomatic language, don't think about complex metaphorical idioms, just keep it simple and you can get a band, 9 amva does an incredible job to express herself clearly and use idiomatic language. Again, according to the publicly available speaking interview marking criteria, grammatical range and accuracy at the band 9 level means that the candidate can use a full range of grammar appropriately and naturally. This means using present perfect conditionals, past perfect passive voice, active voice, and the light One. Quick tip here is listen to the question. If the question is being asked and present, perfect, then definitely use present perfect in your answer. If the question is a conditional, then use the conditional when responding in part 1 Amba does just that. Again, this shows that she is an expert communicator in the English language. The fourth criteria is pronunciation. Now don't overthink this, you do not have to sound exactly like a native speaker. There are a lot of different styles of pronun, conciation, and dialects of English. There's British English, American English, Australian English, Canadian English, Irish English, Scottish English, there are many, and they all sound different. For Band 9 pronunciation, what's important is that your pronunciation is consistent and there is subtlety to your pronunciation. This means that what you are saying can be understood effortlessly by the examiner. What I mean here is that when you're using your words, the examiner doesn't have to kind of squint and go, what was that? What did this person? Oh yeah, okay, that's what they're saying. No, the examiner should just go, yeah, I got that, okay, that's clear. Yeah, and for me in this interview Ama's pronunciation was just that. It was 100 percent clear. I did not have to strain or really try to figure out what she was trying to say. Her words were subtle and accurate and clearly pronounced. So practice these four features individually, grammar, pronunciation, lexical resource fluency, and then put them together for that high, high band score. But can do it.

Well, she fulfills all of the criteria of fluency and coherence, lexical resource, grammatical range, and accuracy, and pronunciation. For fluency, she speaks without pausing to think about vocabulary or grammar to express herself. She is coherent, she answers all questions with a lot of detail and giving good explanations. Her lexical resource is broad, she's able to paraphrase elements of the questions in her answers. She's able to use expressions and idiomatic language naturally, and she's able to use a broad range of vocabulary for grammatical range and accuracy. She is accurate most of the time, only making occasional mistakes the native speaker could also make. She uses complex grammar, including present, perfect past, perfect continuous forms, passive forms and conditionals. Medina's pronunciation is clear and easily comprehensible, although she does not sound like a native speaker of English, all of her words can be easily understood. So for these reasons, she gets the band 9 score on her speaking interview. You can do the same, just make sure to practice daily and you will improve. Use English as much as possible.

So me and my friends play cricket. I was a member of the Royals from the age of 6, 2 16, so for a decade I participated in, practice sessions and games and tournaments. I also did a bit of coaching. We usually had two or three practice sessions a week, and a game at EV once every weekend, either a Saturday or Sunday. The practice sessions used to last for two or three hours. But the game would go on for almost 6 hours. I loved playing cricket and I still do, but not the club anymore, officially. The reason being I do not play cricket well enough to go professionally and it took a lot of my time. So when I had to choose between studies and cricket, I chose studies. Well, having said that, I still do have good connections with former team members and we still share that bond and we do still play cricket.

You will have your mark in about two weeks time with the other sections for your official certificate, and you'll see it online in about three days. Okay, have a great rest of your day, remember to take your passport with you, thank you, thank you, bye bye. Now that you've finisheded watching the interview with lartica, let's discuss her score in more detail. Overall, lartica would score a band 8, which is a very good score. According to the IELTS band score descriptors. She has to be proud of achieving such a high score, and this is certainly enough for university and immigration. So why does she lose that one band? Well, let's take a look at the detailed marking criteria. As I had mentioned before, her fluency score is a band 9. As soon as I ask her a question, she's able to come up with clear, fluent answers right away, speaking quickly and continuously, giving answers, explanations, and examples using a variety of vocabulary, she does not pause to think about grammar or words, so clearly. She's able to hold a conversation on general and in specific topics. Her coherence score is a little bit lower. Her coherence is a band aid, some of her answers are slightly awkward and don't make 100 percent sense in the real world. I would stop and follow up on some of the points that she says to get a bit further clarity. However, she does not say any answers which are very confusing or which have no connection to the question being asked. So in this case, her coherence is a band 8. A couple instances where lartika's coherence is a bit confusing is when she uses the expression over there to finished her sentence. It doesn't make clear sense what she is actually referring to, although this may be a part of her diction, it still needs to make sense for the listener as well. She has that one idiom to hit two birds with one stone When she's speaking about pollution and carbon emissions. The idiom is somewhat forced in this answer, and it doesn't quite make sense in this context. Be very careful not to force idioms into your speaking responses. Only use them when they come naturally and when they make absolute sense. Going into more detail, lartica's lexical resource is a bad and 8, she uses a broad range of vocabulary. She uses expressions, correlative, subordinating, and coordinating conjunctions. Well, she also often provides synonyms for words, which she uses again and again. And overall, she does show strong command of English vocabulary. I would estimate that her vocabulary base is anywhere from 2 to 3000 words minimum. However, there are a few instances where she is redundant, specifically in part 2 when she is talking about the A four piece of printer paper, she repeats the word purpose quite frequently, ideally for a band 9, instead of repeating the word purpose, she would use words like for the goal or for the aim. For this reason, using different kinds of synonyms and expressions to express the idea of a purpose. In addition, she could have used some more advanced vocabulary in certain questions to give more specific concepts and make clear ideas. This is especially true 4 part 3. Her grammatical range and accuracy is somewhat similar to her lexical resource mark. She does show a broad range of grammar, including present perfect, a progressive form, passive form, but there are some cases where she could use some more complex grammar to add an extra layer of clarity and accuracy to her language. Again, this takes a lot of practice, but a band 8 for grammatical range and accuracy is very good indeed. Her pronunciation score is again about a band 8. All of the words that she uses are clear and comprehensible. However, in some cases her pronunciation is slightly awkward, but it does not lead to confusion. If pronunciation leads to confusion, it will decrease the score further because it will also affect the coherent score. In larticus case, her pronunciation does not affect her coherence.

                "input": "jellia earns an incredible band 9 on her speaking part 1 for several reasons. Right away during the introduction when she presents her ID and gives her name, she shows calm, confident and fluent English. She explains to the examiner her full name and then requests the examiner to call her jalio afterwards for every single answer In part 1 she is able to produce accurate, detailed, grammatically complex responses, showing great lexical resource and clear pronunciation. Let's take a look at some of these questions and answers in detail for the icebreaker question, where she lives real answers with detail and she does not rush her response. She explains that she lives in a three bedroom house in the suburbs of Kolkata. Notice that beautiful vocabulary right away, in fact, she even includes present perfect saying I've lived here all my life right away. This tells the examiner that he is dealing with an expert user of the English language. A lot of students rush into their answers and because they're trying to speak too quickly, they miss complex grammar and they miss details. It is not a good idea to try to speak too quickly, it's better to focus on coherence, structure, vocabulary, and grammar jalio cleverly paraphrases many of the keywords in the examiner's question. When the examiner asks about what she does in her free time, she responds by saying that in my spare time, this is showing the examiner that band 9 level lexical resource to get those high band scores. During your speaking interview, you have to paraphrase often This not only shows lexical resource, but also improves the coherence of your answers, making your answers more understandable for the listener. In fact, coherence is also improved by jaliel's ability to connect among her responses when the examiner asks her about where her parents live, she makes the connection by saying, as I had mentioned earlier, I live in the same house as my parents. It's this type of connect negative information that really leads to that expert level of communication. Now, many of you probably realized that jaliel uses frequent natural fillers during her speech. Natural fillers are sound expressions like and and she even breaks her eye contact kind of looking away or looking down. This is called mental referencing, meaning that she's looking inside of her mind to think about good ideas and information to say to the examiner she is not stuck for vocabulary or for grammar. This is clear. So in this case, the Oz and Ums in jalio's speech do not take away from her overall performance. In fact, they improve it because the quality of her answers are that much better. Another very important skill that jalile adapts for part 1 is her visual speech. This means that her answers are easy for the examiner to picture in his mind when the examiner asks about what she would change about her parents, she responds by saying, if I could wave my magic wand, I would give my parents more financial security so that they would never have to worry about money. This is very natural visual language, again, leading to that expert level of communication as we watch the rest of this interview and lesson, I want to give you the ultimate help for a perfect band 9 score on your next IELTS exam.

                "output": "About a year ago, I had a chance to briefly meet with anaica Canna, who is one of the most well known fashion designers in India, and I remember being super nervous as she has been, one of my idols and inspirations, since my teenage years. Miss Kana is a beautiful and hardworking fashion designer who's well known for blending traditional Indian textile with western silhouettes. Her designs are just stunning. I had a chance to meet with her during the culture week in New Delhi, in the year of 2016, she has been showcased in Paris Fashion week and it's fair to say that her designs are recognized not just in India, but also worldwide. And the culture week that I mentioned before, it was a fashion event that I had attended as a teenager and it was life changing for me. I was austacked by all the beauty, creativity, and glamour of the event and I knew that I wanted to be a part of it. After the fashion shows, there was a chance for the public to meet with some of the celebrity designers, including Miss Kenner, who was by that time an idol. For me. I had always wondered, what had inspired her to become a fashion designer, and even more importantly, where she draws her creative inspiration for her amazing productions. I remember having butterflies in my stomach when I finally got a chance to, speak with her. And I felt like I wouldn't be able to make a sound. She was, very pleasant and made me feel comfortable. I asked her my questions and she kindly replied, this was definitely one of the most nerve racking interactions I've ever had. And, it was also exhilarating. "

Part 2 of the speaking interview is arguably the most challenging because most people do not practice giving short speeches, especially not in a foreign language on a daily basis. However, jaliel does a fantastic job and she is well prepared. Clearly, she has rehearsed and practiced responding to part 2 questions before sitting the exam. This is evident from the way she starts her response when the examiner tells her that her one minute preparation time is up, she looks from the note paper, takes a breath, places her hands on the table, and calmly, confidently presents her first sentence. She explains that about a year ago she had the chance to meet with animica kana, who had made her very nervous at that time, paying attention to responding to the topic question on the cue card. Talk about a person that made you nervous. It's very important that you answer that topic question right away. In fact, jellio not only reflects the topic of the cue card, but she emphasizes it by saying that she was super nervous throughout her one to 2 minute response, Julia takes natural pauses, checking the Q card and checking her notes. This is very important for her to give a well structured, detailed and non repetitive answer. A lot of students forget to do this. They get frustrated, they get nervous, they forget about their notes, and they forget about the questions. They tend to repeat themselves and run out of ideas. Stay confident, stay calm, use your notes, jillio continues to use Ben 9 lexical resource Throughout speaking part 2, she explains that she would ask Miss Kana about where she draws her inspiration and her ideas. In fact, she even uses an idiom to reflect the topic of the Q card. She says that she had butterflies in her stomach, meaning that she was very nervous. Cleverly jillio reflects the topic right away at the beginning, around the middle and again at the end of her response, she says that it was a very nerve racking experience, but then it was exhilarating. Keep in mind that for that band 9 score, you need to focus on the questions of the Q card. You cannot go off topic. If you do, there's a good chance the examiner will stop you one way to save yourself from going off topic is to reflect back on the original question, talk about a person that made you feel nervous, jalil does this exceptionally. Now on to part 3. For this part, I will ask you a question related to your response and some questions connected to this topic. Have you ever had the chance to meet with, Miss Kana since that time?

                "output": "I had a truly lovely, dining experience at under the Mango Tree Restaurant, which is located in the west part of Bhopal, not too far from the national Park and Lake. I had been there with my parents and one of my close friends, we really didn't have any chance to go out and enjoy a restaurant due to the pandemic lockdown. And my dad splurged a bit and took us for a fine dining restaurant. I did a bit of research online for under the mango tree and found the reviews to be great. 4.5, out of 5 and the ambience is truly amazing. The restaurant is located inside the palace and there are sitting on the rooftop overlooking the pool. There are lanterns all around and it is a open air and we literally sit around a big beautiful mango tree. This is a barbecue restaurant and they sold us dishes which are served to the royal families over the centuries, an opportunity to taste variety of dishes like curries and kebabs, as well as some rice dishes and delicious lussy. So much of the experience was outstanding. The service, the food, the ambience, it was splendid. It is really hard to say how under the mango tree, could be even better with all the services they provide, but I suppose the service could be faster. Personally, I think there is no rush for a person when he's sitting under such a beautiful place. Of course it could be cheaper, but with the quality of service they provide, they couldn't do it any cheaper. In all, I feel it is a perfect experience. "

                "input": "So why does Toronto deserve this solid Van 9 for her performance on the speaking section? Her speaking isn't flawless, it means that she does make some mistakes, but they are far and few between. So what is required to be graded? An expert user on the IELTS exam? Simply put, clear, coherent detail, an original conversation. What do I mean by conversation? I mean that this 12 to 15 minute interview should come across as a connected piece of information. Let's take a look at part 1 where tarana is talking about newspapers and magazines. In this part, tarana gives clear detail and visual communication for each of the questions. When asked about when she has read a newspaper or a magazine, she explains to the examiner that she hasn't actually read a carbon copy, newspaper or magazine as long as she can remember, unless it's an issue that she's picked up at a superstore while maybe waiting at the checkout. This creates a visual image and clear communication tarana uses a lot of detailed vocabulary. She names a few different types of publications for digital magazines in India, and she connects these like Femina amongst various answers. It's clear that she's nervous and at times she fumbles her words, but overall it's excellent communication. She uses natural expressions as well as collocations throughout her responses. In part 2, the Q card or long part tiranna's band 9 level communication really shines as she explains her experience at Under the Mango Tree Restaurant. It's clear that Toronto knows when talking about a location like under the Mango Tree Restaurant, it's important to talk about where it is. It's important to talk about the people that go there, the activities that happen there, and then her experiences. She clearly explains that under the Mango Tree is near a national park in a specific area of Bhopal. She then explains what the restaurant looks like, the ambience of the restaurant with the lanterns and the big, beautiful mango tree. She talks about her parents, her friend, and her being there for a fine dining experience. She explains that there is a barbecue style menu there. The foods that she tried, the conversations that she you have, it's this kind of structure when talking about a location that gives that band 9 level idea to the exam, it's important to practice this kind of structured communication for part 2, whether it's about a location, a person object event, or an idea. Each of these categories, like a location, has a specific set of information that you need to present. Clearly, Tara has practiced this, and this is why she's able to get that band 9. Let's take a look at part 3 in part 3, as with part 1, tarana continues a conversation style communication with the information is connected when asked about popular restaurants, she answers fast food places with examples like KFC and McDonald's, but that she also reflects back to part 2, saying that fine dining restaurants like under the manual tree are also popular. She uses a broad range of grammar, accurately not only present, perfect and conditional, but even a direct quote, she says that in the hospitality industry, the saying that the customer is always right is very important. This is natural, it's not forced, although tirano at times hesitates and even slightly fumbles her words. These are not unnatural mistakes, she is original, she stays on topic and gives enough content for the examiner to grade her a bad 9. You too can do this with practice, good luck the next time you sit your IELTS. Exam more video lessons like this original practice exams, a fully attractive course, and an app for your phone.

I had been there with my parents and one of my close friends, we really didn't have any chance to go out and enjoy a restaurant due to the pandemic lockdown. And my dad splurged a bit and took us for a fine dining restaurant. I did a bit of research online for under the mango tree and found the reviews to be great. 4.5, out of 5 and the ambience is truly amazing. The restaurant is located inside the palace and there are sitting on the rooftop overlooking the pool. There are lanterns all around and it is a open air and we literally sit around a big beautiful mango tree. This is a barbecue restaurant and they sold us dishes which are served to the royal families over the centuries, an opportunity to taste variety of dishes like curries and kebabs, as well as some rice dishes and delicious lussy. So much of the experience was outstanding. The service, the food, the ambience, it was splendid. It is really hard to say how under the mango tree, could be even better with all the services they provide, but I suppose the service could be faster. Personally, I think there is no rush for a person when he's sitting under such a beautiful place. Of course it could be cheaper, but with the quality of service they provide, they couldn't do it any cheaper. In all, I feel it is a perfect experience. "

Her speaking isn't flawless, it means that she does make some mistakes, but they are far and few between. So what is required to be graded? An expert user on the IELTS exam? Simply put, clear, coherent detail, an original conversation. What do I mean by conversation? I mean that this 12 to 15 minute interview should come across as a connected piece of information. Let's take a look at part 1 where tarana is talking about newspapers and magazines. In this part, tarana gives clear detail and visual communication for each of the questions. When asked about when she has read a newspaper or a magazine, she explains to the examiner that she hasn't actually read a carbon copy, newspaper or magazine as long as she can remember, unless it's an issue that she's picked up at a superstore while maybe waiting at the checkout. This creates a visual image and clear communication tarana uses a lot of detailed vocabulary. She names a few different types of publications for digital magazines in India, and she connects these like Femina amongst various answers. It's clear that she's nervous and at times she fumbles her words, but overall it's excellent communication. She uses natural expressions as well as collocations throughout her responses. In part 2, the Q card or long part tiranna's band 9 level communication really shines as she explains her experience at Under the Mango Tree Restaurant. It's clear that Toronto knows when talking about a location like under the Mango Tree Restaurant, it's important to talk about where it is. It's important to talk about the people that go there, the activities that happen there, and then her experiences. She clearly explains that under the Mango Tree is near a national park in a specific area of Bhopal. She then explains what the restaurant looks like, the ambience of the restaurant with the lanterns and the big, beautiful mango tree. She talks about her parents, her friend, and her being there for a fine dining experience. She explains that there is a barbecue style menu there. The foods that she tried, the conversations that she you have, it's this kind of structure when talking about a location that gives that band 9 level idea to the exam, it's important to practice this kind of structured communication for part 2, whether it's about a location, a person object event, or an idea. Each of these categories, like a location, has a specific set of information that you need to present. Clearly, Tara has practiced this, and this is why she's able to get that band 9. Let's take a look at part 3 in part 3, as with part 1, tarana continues a conversation style communication with the information is connected when asked about popular restaurants, she answers fast food places with examples like KFC and McDonald's, but that she also reflects back to part 2, saying that fine dining restaurants like under the manual tree are also popular. She uses a broad range of grammar, accurately not only present, perfect and conditional, but even a direct quote, she says that in the hospitality industry, the saying that the customer is always right is very important. This is natural, it's not forced, although tirano at times hesitates and even slightly fumbles her words. These are not unnatural mistakes, she is original, she stays on topic and gives enough content for the examiner to grade her a bad 9. You too can do this with practice, good luck the next time you sit your IELTS. Exam more video lessons like this original practice exams, a fully attractive course, and an app for your phone.

So I really wanted to cheer her up. So after my conversation with her, I really wanted to do something special to put a smile on her face. So I decided to call up all my friends for a surprise night out. I discovered that there's a place called Mystery Rooms Mumbai where we can all play together to escape from a room. It's basically a place where we all play together to solve out a mystery, to get out of a room with all kinds, kinds of excitement and danger. So we chose the con theme that's kind of like a mission impossible story where we had to get away with a big diamond. So all that was needed to make this happen was to call up all my friends. And that was about thousand rupees per head for admission. And we got one of our friends got to get there. So anyhow, my three friends, including sagel, and I went there and really had a blast on a Friday night. We were like screaming there and laughing for like 3 or four hours. And the best thing is we were able to escape out of the room just in time and it was really great. So after everything, sagel was really happy, like I think she was really cheered up. She left on a positive vibe for the entire following week that helped her in getting a new job that was better than her previous job.

He has his hands up on the table and making good eye contact with the examiner. He projects. His voice speaks loud, loudly and clearly. Right away in the introductory questions, he uses good vocabulary, stating that he had been doing some vocational study before working. When asked why routines are important, he gives a very natural and clear answer, stating that it helps him grow as an individual. Again, this indicates a high degree of familiarity with the English language. Later, in Part 1, when the examiner asks him if his routines have changed over the years, Ryan recognizes the present perfect grammar in the question, and he not only uses the present perfect once, but instead he uses it twice in his answer. In the beginning, he says it has changed a lot, and then again he says it has changed quite a bit. This is a very good strategy to show the examiner that the candidate has grammatical range and accuracy Pay attention to the grammar of the questions if they are past perfect, use past perfect. If it's a conditional, use the conditional in your answer, and if it's present, perfect, use the present perfect and use it twice. Practice this at home before you sit the aislets exam, Let's take a look at Ryan's part 2 for the long answer, the Q card questions asking about what the candidate has done to make a person happy Ryan takes all the necessary steps for that perfect Band 9 score. He takes notes, answers each of the questions on the card, has great structure, vocabulary, grammatic, medical range, and a lot of detail in his one to two minutes response. It is noteworthy to state that Ryan uses wonderful natural sounding expressions and vocabulary to paint a clear picture about how he helped to cheer up his friend Seagull by taking her to the mystery rooms in Mumbai instead of saying that she was fired from her job, he uses the more subtle expression of she was let go from her job. He explains that this happened because the company was downsizing again, a nice piece of vocabulary to indicate that the company was becoming smaller throughout his response, he uses some idiomatic language, like he helped put a smile on her face, meaning again, that he helped to cheer up his friend to make her happy. He's circling back to the topic of the Q card, making sure that he stays on topic notice, notice the great level of deep tail that Ryan puts into his response, making it sound original. He explains to the examiner that the mystery room was kind of like a contheme or mission impossible style adventure where they had to steal a diamond and escape with it. He clearly explains how much it cost them to participate in this activity and how they felt afterwards in order to get a band 9 in the speaking section, you really do need to sound original in part 2 and include a lot of detail. Avoid using templates like Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak or saying I have made a lot of people happy, but the person I would like to talk about today is these might get you an okay score, but they will not get you that band 8 or that band 9. Instead, focus on the topic and focus on details. Now let's talk about part 3. In part 3, Ryan stays on track for a band 9 by providing clear and accurate answers to every single question one strategy that he uses to attain this is applying the question in his answers when the examiner asks him if he has recommended this activity to any of his friends, he reflects this sentence. In his response, he says, yes, I have recommended going to this mystery room in Mumbai to at least a dozen other people. This strategy is very useful to both build fluency and accuracy in part 3, Ryan cleverly includes examples to support his answers and explanations. These examples are smooth and he does not say, for example, or for instance, like when he gives the example of his grandmother, who has had to face many more hardships than people today, this makes his explanation very clear about how life has become easier and more positive for people nowadays than in the past. You too need to use these kinds of examples to get those high, high band scores. Last but not least, ryesh pays attention to connect information among the different parts of the interview and his answers When asked about sharing his memories with others, he tells the examiner that he has in fact shared pictures of his experience in Mystery Rooms Mumbai. This type of connectivity among ideas definitely helps the candidate to achieve that perfect band 9. Make sure to practice this at home before you sit your next IELTS exam.

                "output": "A tool that is quite dangerous, which I have used before, is a chainsaw. This is a gas powered wood cutting tool that has a handle and a motor with a metal bar extending from it. And around the bar there is a chain with sharp teeth. The motor and handle have a plastic cover which is a bright orange color. The last time I had used the chainsaw was about 10 months ago when I was helping my uncle clean up around his property and get some firewood ready. Use the chain so to remove some dead branches from trees around property. And I also cut down a couple of smaller trees that were either dead or overcrowded. Chainsaw can be quite dangerous if it is not, maintained or rehandled. It is a very powerful cutting tool which can slice into a person's knee, leg or foot and cause a lot of damage to tissues and even bones. And also if the user cuts into hard material like metal or rock, or if the chain is worn out and not replaced, the saw can break and the pieces can come apart. Flying pieces of the chain or the material being cut like the pieces of wood or pebbles can damage the user's eyes and even blind them. So whenever a person is using a chainsaw, they must wear the correct safety equipment. The most important are nice pair of boots, preferably with steel toes, earmuffs to protect the ears from the loud sound of the engine, and safety glasses. There are special pants which can protect the legs from the chain and also a helmet is a good idea to protect the head in case of falling branches. "

Make sure to practice these steps. Now let me give you a few important details about what you have to pay attention to when you sit your outs exam during the Covid pandemic. IELTS test centers are taking several precautionary steps to make sure that you and everyone else stays healthy on your test day. For these reasons, you will not be allowed to enter the IELTS test center Before you're given time. You will receive an email from IELTS telling you what is the earliest time that you can enter the test center as well. This email will include all of the following points. Firstly, you will have to wear a face mask at all times during your exam. As soon as you enter the test center as well, you will have to wash your hands and use a hand sanitizer. You can bring your own hand sanitizer, which is a good idea, but it must not have any writing or it must not have a label on it as well. They will check your temperature if you show any symptoms of a cold or flu, you will not be allowed to sit your exam. If you are feeling ill before your IELTS test day, make sure to contact your exam center and ask for your exam to be rescheduled. In addition, you will have to bring your own pen, pencil and eraser. Your eraser again must not have a covering or have any writing on it as well. You should bring a water bottle. The water bottle should be transparent and again must not have any label or writing on it. Pay attention to these details and arrive to your test center early. Dress according to the weather so that you're not hot or cold if you have to stand outside for five or 10 minutes, you should take with you some speaking scripts that you can leave in the coat room, which you can use to practice with other people who are waiting to enter the exam center.

                "output": "Recently I have been considering learning to play chess in order to improve my thinking in mind. Of course, chess is one of the oldest board games which requires a lot of calculation and strategic planning. Basically chess is where there are two players, Here's on checkered board with 16 game pieces each. Every piece is moved according to precise rules and the goal is to place the opening skin under attack with no escape. I've been inspired by a new series on Netflix called Queen's Gambit, which is about a woman who is a brilliant chess player and chess has been played by millions of people for over centuries and it is common, commonly known as a game that develops critical thinking and foresight. An important element of the game is to predict the open and smooths and always be one step ahead of them.

Ryanna is a very strong IELTS candidate and she would certainly get a perfect band 9 for her performance on this speaking interview, meaning that she is an expert user of the English language. This doesn't just simply mean that she has vocabulary and grammar approximately that of a native English speaker. In fact, it's more than that. It means that she's able to express even complex ideas very clearly with detail and great fluency. Allow me to explain this in further detail. In Part 1, ryanna begins by showing lots of confidence, she is oozing a positive attitude, she is very fluent right off the bat with a broad range of vocabulary to express her ideas precisely. While talking about sleep, she uses natural expressions like to give me a full charge for the day or sleep like a baby. It's this kind of quick, clever language that gets those high, high band scores. Furthermore, ryanna has very strong connections among her ideas, making her communication comprehensive. She's constantly relating among her answers, she says, as I have mentioned before as well, she always emphasizes her explanations by giving clear examples, like the example I was watching a movie with my friend late last night. Her examples are smooth and integrated. She doesn't use the expressions, for example, or for instance, rather she just gives the example, making it seamless and not giving an opportunity for the exam to interrupt her with another question. It's this kind of clever and clear communication that leads to a perfect band 9 score for part 2, the Q card. The long answer ryanna makes an excellent choice. She chooses the topic chess to discuss an activity which she has been doing to enhance her mind. Likely she thought about a few different ideas before settling on the game of chess. Then while giving her answer, she pays a lot of attention to having a structured response, describing first the game of chess, the rules of chess, and then explaining how this game helps to enhance her mind while giving real world explanations and examples. It's this type of structured, fluent, and detailed response that gets that perfect Band 9 score. Last but not least, ryanna in Part 3 continues to show excellence in her speaking all the way until her very last answer. She uses incredible vocabulary and natural expressions like an unhealthy body will certainly deteriorate the mind or the brain is a biological machine. In addition, her answers are complex and detailed in nature. For instance, when she says, while I was studying for this aisle exam, I identified my mistakes and learned from these, I realized that I made verb tense errors in my writing. It's this level of accuracy, complexity, and confidence that will lead you to a perfect score.

Basically chess is where there are two players, Here's on checkered board with 16 game pieces each. Every piece is moved according to precise rules and the goal is to place the opening skin under attack with no escape. I've been inspired by a new series on Netflix called Queen's Gambit, which is about a woman who is a brilliant chess player and chess has been played by millions of people for over centuries and it is common, commonly known as a game that develops critical thinking and foresight. An important element of the game is to predict the open and smooths and always be one step ahead of them.

Ryanna is a very strong IELTS candidate and she would certainly get a perfect band 9 for her performance on this speaking interview, meaning that she is an expert user of the English language. This doesn't just simply mean that she has vocabulary and grammar approximately that of a native English speaker. In fact, it's more than that. It means that she's able to express even complex ideas very clearly with detail and great fluency. Allow me to explain this in further detail. In Part 1, ryanna begins by showing lots of confidence, she is oozing a positive attitude, she is very fluent right off the bat with a broad range of vocabulary to express her ideas precisely. While talking about sleep, she uses natural expressions like to give me a full charge for the day or sleep like a baby. It's this kind of quick, clever language that gets those high, high band scores. Furthermore, ryanna has very strong connections among her ideas, making her communication comprehensive. She's constantly relating among her answers, she says, as I have mentioned before as well, she always emphasizes her explanations by giving clear examples, like the example I was watching a movie with my friend late last night. Her examples are smooth and integrated. She doesn't use the expressions, for example, or for instance, rather she just gives the example, making it seamless and not giving an opportunity for the exam to interrupt her with another question. It's this kind of clever and clear communication that leads to a perfect band 9 score for part 2, the Q card. The long answer ryanna makes an excellent choice. She chooses the topic chess to discuss an activity which she has been doing to enhance her mind. Likely she thought about a few different ideas before settling on the game of chess. Then while giving her answer, she pays a lot of attention to having a structured response, describing first the game of chess, the rules of chess, and then explaining how this game helps to enhance her mind while giving real world explanations and examples. It's this type of structured, fluent, and detailed response that gets that perfect Band 9 score. Last but not least, ryanna in Part 3 continues to show excellence in her speaking all the way until her very last answer. She uses incredible vocabulary and natural expressions like an unhealthy body will certainly deteriorate the mind or the brain is a biological machine. In addition, her answers are complex and detailed in nature. For instance, when she says, while I was studying for this aisle exam, I identified my mistakes and learned from these, I realized that I made verb tense errors in my writing. It's this level of accuracy, complexity, and confidence that will lead you to a perfect score.

By this I mean implementing a few simple, yes, strict laws that the society in the world must comply in order to minimize the energy consumption and waste whenever possible. I really started to think about this deeply about half a decade ago when I come into the realization that many companies and people in the world are creating a lot of waste and pollutions and because of their ignorance, let me explain this a bit more clearly with an example. The world now has energy efficient Led lights and rechargeable batteries, yet the stores are still selling energy in efficient light and disposable batteries and people still buy them this kind of, energy in efficient light, not just waste electricity, but also, the chemicals and materials in these products are really harmful for the environment, even though people are allowed to recycle their battery nowadays, many of them still end up in the landfill and the acid is causing major damage to the water and land with 8 billion people on earth. I believe it is gross negligence to overlook this issue. In fact, such regulation, would be cost efficient for people and society in the long run. So money really shouldn't be an excuse. I believe by banning the energy in efficient, light and disposable batteries, the plan, the planet would be a better place in both flora and fauna, as well as people who live healthier lives. I think the reason why such regulation hasn't been implemented yet is because of our greed and ignorance in order to make this happen, people and government must unite together again like they did for banning the plastic shopping bag.

By this I mean implementing a few simple, yes, strict laws that the society in the world must comply in order to minimize the energy consumption and waste whenever possible. I really started to think about this deeply about half a decade ago when I come into the realization that many companies and people in the world are creating a lot of waste and pollutions and because of their ignorance, let me explain this a bit more clearly with an example. The world now has energy efficient Led lights and rechargeable batteries, yet the stores are still selling energy in efficient light and disposable batteries and people still buy them this kind of, energy in efficient light, not just waste electricity, but also, the chemicals and materials in these products are really harmful for the environment, even though people are allowed to recycle their battery nowadays, many of them still end up in the landfill and the acid is causing major damage to the water and land with 8 billion people on earth. I believe it is gross negligence to overlook this issue. In fact, such regulation, would be cost efficient for people and society in the long run. So money really shouldn't be an excuse. I believe by banning the energy in efficient, light and disposable batteries, the plan, the planet would be a better place in both flora and fauna, as well as people who live healthier lives. I think the reason why such regulation hasn't been implemented yet is because of our greed and ignorance in order to make this happen, people and government must unite together again like they did for banning the plastic shopping bag.

In the end, we were a bronze medalist and third position until 12 different teams. We are really happy with the result, but of course we had to wish we won gold. My brother and sister and I, we've been feeling a bit estranged from one another since moving away from home as we are all busy with our jobs and daily social lives. So we take turns in choosing social names like Monopoly and charades. And whoever's turn it is to choose a game is also the host. I think this way has helped us to release some stress and also to become closer to each other this way as well. We have rehandled on our relationship with each other and I feel as close as ever to my siblings. "

I want to tell you two important pieces of information, one, how to learn this kind of vocabulary, idioms, expressions effectively, and two, how to use them effectively in your next exam so that you too can get high band scores. All right, let's talk about learning vocabulary. In order to truly learn vocabulary so that you can clearly understand it in conversation and so that you can clearly use it in communication, you need to follow 3 important steps. Number one, write out the definition of the word. Number two, create an example, sentence number 3, paraphrase your sentence. Now here are a few more tips When you are writing your example sentence. First, make it a compound sentence. Make it a complex sentence. Second, make the sentence interesting. Third, include yourself into the sentence so that it becomes personal so that your brain holds on to this information. Take a look at this example. My second point is to use vocabulary expressions and especially idioms effectively in your speaking interview so that they help to increase your score and not decrease your core. This means using idioms naturally. Don't force idioms just so that you use them. Only use them when they fit the context of your communication. Also, stay away from overly complicated idioms like don't throw bricks when you live in a glass house. Instead, it's better to stick to just shorter idioms, like the idioms that you saw in these examples. Two to three word idioms. I live in the heart of London. These are also considered natural, idiomatic expressions and will help you to boost your score without creating confusion. Be sure to practice these and good luck the next time you sit your IELTS.

Remember to take your passport with you and have a great rest of your day. Thank you very much, Thank you Bye bye Rima gets a band 9 expert user of English for her speaking interview, her lexical resource fluency and coherence, grammar range and accuracy, and pronunciation are outstanding. She clearly understands every question, gives fluent and complete answers using a broad range of grammar and vocabulary. Importantly, she pays attention to giving answers, explanations and lots of details. Her speech is original, it's clear that she's not just simply memorizing expressions to use during the exam, but she is confident expressing herself in just about any context of English. So what are some important points to pay attention to when wearing a medical mask? As you know, medical masks are irritating, they make breathing slightly more difficult, and they muffle speech, so you have to compensate for these extra challenges. It's already difficult enough and stressful enough to sit the speaking interview without a face mask on. The face mask definitely gives an an added level of challenge. Here are a few tips to follow in order to make sure that you do the best that you can and get a high band score. Tip number one, bring your own medical mask. Invest some time to find a comfortable mask that fits you well and that you can breathe in as easily as possiblelest. Exams are expensive, so make sure to spend a few extra dollars and get a medical mask that is as good as possible for you. Look around, shop, shop around. Tip number two, practice the speaking interview with partners Using a medical mask, it's important that you have a feeling of what it's like to communicate in this context. With a mask on. You should not be experiencing a face mask for the first time when you sit the official exam. This is just asking for trouble. Tip number three, pay extra attention to staying calm. Remember, visualize the examiner as if they're your grandmother or your your grandfather, feel really comfortable speaking to them when you're wearing a face mask, it's much easier to become even more anxious because it's making breathing difficult. When a person is nervous and their breathing is impeded, they become even more anxious. So you must practice at home and in partners to stay calm and stay focused. Tip tip number 4, enunciate in communication. We get a lot of information from the movement of the mouth with a medical mask. Of course, we cannot see the movement of the mouth, so it becomes much more important to enunciate words. That means inflections and deflections in your intonation and your pronunciation be a little bit melodramatic, really pronounce your words. Also keep your hands and your arms above the table during the interview and use hand gestures just like I'm doing right now because the examiner is not getting information from the movement of your mouth. It's a good idea to substitute a bit with your hands and your eyes, okay? So make sure to follow these 4 tips and practice them when you're having to wear the face mask for your next speaking interview.

Remember to take your passport with you and have a great rest of your day. Thank you very much, Thank you Bye bye Rima gets a band 9 expert user of English for her speaking interview, her lexical resource fluency and coherence, grammar range and accuracy, and pronunciation are outstanding. She clearly understands every question, gives fluent and complete answers using a broad range of grammar and vocabulary. Importantly, she pays attention to giving answers, explanations and lots of details. Her speech is original, it's clear that she's not just simply memorizing expressions to use during the exam, but she is confident expressing herself in just about any context of English. So what are some important points to pay attention to when wearing a medical mask? As you know, medical masks are irritating, they make breathing slightly more difficult, and they muffle speech, so you have to compensate for these extra challenges. It's already difficult enough and stressful enough to sit the speaking interview without a face mask on. The face mask definitely gives an an added level of challenge. Here are a few tips to follow in order to make sure that you do the best that you can and get a high band score. Tip number one, bring your own medical mask. Invest some time to find a comfortable mask that fits you well and that you can breathe in as easily as possiblelest. Exams are expensive, so make sure to spend a few extra dollars and get a medical mask that is as good as possible for you. Look around, shop, shop around. Tip number two, practice the speaking interview with partners Using a medical mask, it's important that you have a feeling of what it's like to communicate in this context. With a mask on. You should not be experiencing a face mask for the first time when you sit the official exam. This is just asking for trouble. Tip number three, pay extra attention to staying calm. Remember, visualize the examiner as if they're your grandmother or your your grandfather, feel really comfortable speaking to them when you're wearing a face mask, it's much easier to become even more anxious because it's making breathing difficult. When a person is nervous and their breathing is impeded, they become even more anxious. So you must practice at home and in partners to stay calm and stay focused. Tip tip number 4, enunciate in communication. We get a lot of information from the movement of the mouth with a medical mask. Of course, we cannot see the movement of the mouth, so it becomes much more important to enunciate words. That means inflections and deflections in your intonation and your pronunciation be a little bit melodramatic, really pronounce your words. Also keep your hands and your arms above the table during the interview and use hand gestures just like I'm doing right now because the examiner is not getting information from the movement of your mouth. It's a good idea to substitute a bit with your hands and your eyes, okay? So make sure to follow these 4 tips and practice them when you're having to wear the face mask for your next speaking interview.

                "input": "So let me explain to you why Everett or Wang Young gets this perfect band 9 and let me give you some more tips and tricks on what to do when you have these annoying face masks and these dividers between you and the examiner. Well, first of all Wen Yang does a brilliant, brilliant job of answering all of the questions exactly, using the grammar of the questions, giving clear explanations, and often including examples he's confident, professional and well expressed throughout the interview. He uses a broad range of vocabulary and stays fluent, even though he makes a couple of slight mistakes. He's really good at self correcting. This is something that native speakers also do. In addition, he uses many different kinds of grammar to reflect the questions when they're present. Perfect, he answers using present perfect when they're conditionals, he uses conditionals. His part 2 long answer is well structured with lots of detail and no repetition. Now here are some tips on what to do so you can perform similarly. Wearing a face mask, A very important strategy when you're wearing a face mask is to make sure that you put on your face mask at least an hour to hours before you're speaking interview, even if you don't have to. Some of you may be driving to the exam. If so, make sure that you have your mask on while you're driving in the car. The reason for this is that you need to allow yourself to get comfortable wearing the mask and this will take at least about 30 minutes to an hour to achieve. It's just like climbing up a mountain where the air becomes a bit thinner, it becomes more difficult to breathe. But that's only momentary. Once you spend a bit of time there, your lungs adjust and breathe easily. You need to do the same with a mask. Wear your mask early and let your breathing and your lungs adjust to the mask. This can definitely save you anxiety and difficulty during the speaking. Also, make sure to wear a comfortable face mask that allows you to speak clearly and doesn't move up and down your face while communicating. Be sure to use the same mask that you intend to have on during the interview to practice with before the interview at least four to five times with speaking partners. This will give you more confidence and comfort. All right, now let me give you some tips on what to pay attention to if you have this annoying transparent shield between you and the examiner. The shield, also called a sneeze guard, provides a barrier for the virus between you and the examiner. It also provides a barrier for communication. So you have to get past this. Here are some important points to keep in mind. Firstly, project your voice, enunciate more than usual, say about 10%. Wen Yang does a very good job of this. Notice how he really emphasizes the pronunciation of his words for clarity. In addition, don't fixate on the shield, look past the shield, look at the examiner's face, and make eye contact. Third, keep your hands above the table, you have a mask on, you have a shield in front of you need more information. Let your hands help you with this. Body language is an excellent means of adding information to your words. It will also help you to express yourself with more emphasis. Keep these tips in mind and you too can master the speaking interview and get a high band score like Wang Young. Good luck the next time you sit your IELTS.

It took me a couple of hours to string the beads on the wire until it looked perfectly. Once the strings, I mean the beads on the wire, I crimped the ends with a plier so it would not fall off with use. When I gave Fidia the necklace, she was very happy and I feel that not only did she appreciate the sentimental value of my gift, but she genuinely think it's a beautiful necklace.

And we met at a music video shoot because she's also an actress. So we did this shoot together and it took 12 hours. And so we had to spend a lot of time together. We also had to act together. So we really just connected and got to know each other really well during that shoot. And, the unusual thing that she does is that she always wears two coats on top of each other. So for example, some people would wear like a, you know, one of those inner coats first and then they would put an outer coat on on top of it, But she just wears two like full blown winter coats on top of each other, which is quite strange, like I've never seen them before. So, yeah. But she always says she feels cold. So that's her method of dealing with the winter in Korea. Yeah, so that's quite unusual. But she her style in general is unusual. Like she always dyes part, part of her her hair red. So it's not all of her hair, but just like part of it. And then she would combine like, like workout clothes, like gym wear with heels or the other way around, like a skirt and then like big sneakers. So that's the style that she's in too, usually . "

I think it's so important to wear something that makes you feel good because if you wear clothes that make you look bad or that feel very tight and uncomfortable, it usually, makes you feel annoyed or it can be even a little bit exhausting if the clothes always like, you know, they don't really fit well.

Like if they are working with customers or just at the office.

I'm bye, I guess, trying to just evaluate the situation in a more positive mindset and look at things that I can gain from it inside of the things that I've lost. And it's really important because it gave me a more positive outlook on life. And also it allowed me to stay motivated to study or hang out with my friends or meet new people instead of dwelling on the things I've lost or the past.

I wasn't able to really focus on the current situation and is the present. And by talking and conversing with my parents, I was able to learn, I can kind of get out of this dark spot or the slump, I guess, to by being grateful with what I have and focusing on the positive parts of the current situation rather than the negative parts.

And it's really important to learn that from their parents because the parents have lived many more years and the child. And so they have gone through that process of finding that bright mindset or finding the positive outlook, and they can kind of pass it on to their child rather than the child having to go through trial and error to figure that out on their own, which is really important for the child in their life and going onwards.

Not just because, like, for example, a lot of students go to school or academia, and in that process, they meet a lot of friends and they hang out and spend a lot of time with them. And therefore, it's inevitable that they start to, I guess, adopt a lot of their mindsets, other way of speech or things like that. And therefore, it's important to have good friends, I believe, because I can change, your course of life or Jack can change your attitude, which can really alter your future as well.

And so that part is nurture aspect. And so it's important that they have a positive influence from their parents. So that, they can grow to be more, I guess, well behaved or fitting in society.

But if I put myself in those in the parent's shoes, I think one important step is to first tell this child that it is not right to do this in a public setting. And I guess give them a friendly reminder first instead of just going straight into scolding or being mad at them, because I can start to have a negative impact on them and they can have, a negative outlook on the whole situation. And rather than that, we can give them something positive to focus on and say while you did while this that you did was good, I think you should do this or kind of guide them in a certain way instead of scolding or even hitting or abusing your child, which is really important on the child's development as well.

And but just because for adults or past a certain age doesn't mean that we stop learning or stop gaining new things from life, especially attitudes like I mentioned, but also skills or a manners of behaving in certain situations. Like for example, I have always been in high school. I've got 4 or four years I've been in high school, but now I'm becoming a college student that requires new skills, new, things I need to learn, new attitudes, and therefore i'm, I guess I am an adult technically, but I'm still growing and evolving and learning new things, which is important for any adult as well.

But I think it's important for them to learn and evaluate the current situation and see, the course of history, I guess, and how things are, how things are changing and kind of adopting to that and not restricting their student. I mean, restricting their children in any way of saying, you have to say in this tiny little box, but also allow them to hum, try different things as well.

As a leader, he has a lot of things. And I believe generally he wants my country to be in progress. He took efforts to find the roadblocks and, save our country from corruption. And I think the previous minister was very corrupt and imrankhan did all he could to improve the economy. And most importantly, he created equal rights for men and women and reduced the social barriers. He became the leader, by winning the most votes in the public elections. Honestly I'm not very much into politics, but I believe that he owns a national party. I think it's called the Hurricane in South. And during 2018 election, his party won. Also, I think because he used to be a very popular cricketer in the past, so he has a lot of fan followers. That's how he became the leader. I'm. Anyway, I admire him as a leader because of his visionary leadership. He actually changed the face of our Pakistan from third world country to economic powerhouse.

As a leader, he has a lot of things. And I believe generally he wants my country to be in progress. He took efforts to find the roadblocks and, save our country from corruption. And I think the previous minister was very corrupt and imrankhan did all he could to improve the economy. And most importantly, he created equal rights for men and women and reduced the social barriers. He became the leader, by winning the most votes in the public elections. Honestly I'm not very much into politics, but I believe that he owns a national party. I think it's called the Hurricane in South. And during 2018 election, his party won. Also, I think because he used to be a very popular cricketer in the past, so he has a lot of fan followers. That's how he became the leader. I'm.

The pages are Think Black paper and she used white ink to write, the messages, which makes, the whole thing look lovely. It was one of the nicest present I have ever received in my life.

The pages are Think Black paper and she used white ink to write, the messages, which makes, the whole thing look lovely. It was one of the nicest present I have ever received in my life. It shows how many how my running has become better over the past few years and the photos are memories of some happy occasions. The album was only about, how full, when she gave it to me.

I'm sure you've heard of a cat being stuck in a tree all the time, but it happened, so I got out of the car, assessed the situation, and there was no way I was reaching that cat. It was scared. It was so up, it was up high, nowhere could possibly climate so out of luck. A white van with the ladder on the top, so a work van was driving by. I waved it down. They pull over, which was a miracle. I'm surprised even pulled over, they were like, oh my goodness. Yeah, you can totally use our ladder. So I grabbed the ladder off the truck, propped it against a tree, climbed up the ladder, grabbed the cat, and I'm telling you, when this cat saw me and I put my hands on it, this thing freaked out. It scratched me up and down my arms, It, it tried biting me. It was, it was just freaking out. I wasn't mad at it, but you know, it hurt, it hurt pretty bad. Grabbed his cat, took it down the tree. I handed it to the lady. Oh my gosh, thank you. You know, she was very thankful for the help. Yeah, honestly it, it was just heartwarming to be honest. I think that's why I still remember it. "

                "output": "Yes, probably because when you're in a smaller village, you kind of know everyone and they kind of know you in a sense, like you could go to the store and you probably see after going to the store 10 times, you've probably seen a good 60% of the population of the town, right? You know, someone, they know someone else, and then it's just kind of a small loop because there's not many people, right? You could go to the, you could walk by your neighbor's house and see them leaving to go to the store, right? You can ask them, hey, can you bring me some eggs when you're at the store and bring it back? Sure, you know, they'll come back, bring you some eggs. It's kind of like that close, close friends neighbor idea, I guess you could say behind it, everyone knows everyone. You know, very nice kind helping people, but with the city you don't really know anyone. There's so many people that no one really cares about you know, you'll never see anyone, half the people there ever again. Yeah, I really think that's why, to be honest with you, just, there's less people, right? You can talk to them. "

And then there's people who actually go out of their way to help other people, right? Like firefighters, police, you know, nurses, they literally save people's lives every single day and get these people earned being pages kind of the least if you think of it and comparing to the celebrities.

Like, for example, you'll see a car accident on the side of the road and you'll see it happening. But instead of stopping to help, a lot of people will just call them 1, 1, and that's it. They'll let them handle it. I feel like they just don't want to be bothered or bother anyone else, and interfere in a way. But then there's also people who are selfish. So it's a mix of the two.

Along with that is definitely old people in general, just because they have, you know, a lot of them have Alzheimer's and like other diseases where they can't really function, you know, at a normal rate, I would say.

You know, it's Y, if you're gonna use it, you pay for it, right? It's kind of that sort of deal, but if it, if it comes to like medical or something, I feel like that should be kind of government funded and, you know, they kind of take care of it through taxes.

I went with some friends to see the celebrations there, and I could not believe the number of people there I saw that night. Most people went there to see the fireworks show and the crowd was enormous. People, they were just dancing, thinking, eating. They were just enjoying themselves, having the time of their lives. We went there at about 10 PMA few hours before midnight and we thought it would be busy, but nothing prepared us for such enormous crowd. And then we saw that the traffic was very slow as we approached the downtown area and the central bridge on the river. And as we got closer to the bridge, we could see that the police had sealed off several blocks or from the city. So we had to get out of our car and walk the rest of the way. And it took us up 15 to 20 minutes to reach our destination. And on our way as I got hungry, so I bought some food for myself. And eventually we arrived at the central square and there were so many people, the streets were filled and they were just, they were happy, they were enjoying. And then there was this fantastic lighting display which illuminated the iconic buildings and the whole sky was shining with fireworks. And then we all counted down to midnight and then returned to each other and wished each other a Happy New Year. And those were the prettiest fireworks I had ever seen in my life. And I'm really glad that I went. "

And I think the main reason for the high population density is people moving from smaller town and rural areas to bigger cities in search of employment and better living conditions, which creates a hustle and bustle in the cities and also because of political instability. And, you know, the streets in India are, they're very narrow and people keep building illegal shops and houses, which makes the area even more congested And due to improper enforcement of traffic laws, people bike, their people park their bikes and cars everywhere they want to. So I think it just increases the problem. "

I think it results in greater level of pollution, both the noise and the air, obviously there will be more motor vehicles which will result in more polluted air and more traffic noise because the traffic grows in our city. And another problem would be, I think, disease vulnerability, as during the time of Covid, I saw that it was so hard to maintain social distancing, especially in the markets if you're in India because of the enormous crowd everywhere and then there are other reasons. Lack of space also has a direct effect on your psychological and your physical growth as well. And then the, you know, exploitation of resources leads to inflation, and then there's lack of access to services like clean drinking water or sanitation, which leads to more diseases, increased disease rate in India. And I think the crime rate increases as well. "

These cities should provide better and safer housing for the people, as nearly 50% of the Mumbai's population lives in slums. I mean, they provide great plot for the feel, sorry for the poor and lovely wretches for the liberal writing, but nobody tries to improve the situation or provide a solution for it. The grave consequences of overpopulation needs to be addressed by the government. The government should take steps to regulate the crowd somehow, to disperse the population, even the roads. They're so narrow, and even when they try to build flyovers, a project like that takes at least 4 to five years to get over in India. And during that time, your population doubles, and then you need another fly over. And I think it's important to control the flow of people. And for that, you first need to understand where the flow is coming from. And I think in short term solutions, like during festivals, we celebrate many festivals throughout the year. So if you have proper planning on how to disperse crowd, you can award that . "

You will socialize more, you will interact with people more. And if you're a fan of pretty views as people in the big cities, the starve for full sky views, I think if you're living on the top apartments, you can enjoy beautiful views around the cities and obviously you will have the benefit of living a more peaceful life, because there will be no traffic noise or noise from the streets up there. And yeah, I think those and also living in such buildings is considered luxurious in India. So you have that and disadvantages would be, I think shifting moving in and moving out would be a great stress for you if you have a lot of furniture and I think another problem would arise if you suffer from a medical condition or medical emergency, like for instance, if one of your family member has high blood pressure or arthritis, then it's not favorable from for them to live in on the 20th floor at least. Other than that, I think slow elevators in some buildings are a problem if you have if you're in a hurry, you have to reach somewhere in time that could be a problem.

I'm sure you've heard of a cat being stuck in a tree all the time, but it happened, so I got out of the car, assessed the situation, and there was no way I was reaching that cat. It was scared. It was so up, it was up high, nowhere could possibly climate so out of luck. A white van with the ladder on the top, so a work van was driving by. I waved it down. They pull over, which was a miracle. I'm surprised even pulled over, they were like, oh my goodness. Yeah, you can totally use our ladder. So I grabbed the ladder off the truck, propped it against a tree, climbed up the ladder, grabbed the cat, and I'm telling you, when this cat saw me and I put my hands on it, this thing freaked out. It scratched me up and down my arms, It, it tried biting me. It was, it was just freaking out. I wasn't mad at it, but you know, it hurt, it hurt pretty bad. Grabbed his cat, took it down the tree. I handed it to the lady. Oh my gosh, thank you. You know, she was very thankful for the help. Yeah, honestly it, it was just heartwarming to be honest. I think that's why I still remember it. "

You know, someone, they know someone else, and then it's just kind of a small loop because there's not many people, right?

You can ask them, hey, can you bring me some eggs when you're at the store and bring it back? Sure, you know, they'll come back, bring you some eggs. It's kind of like that close, close friends neighbor idea, I guess you could say behind it, everyone knows everyone. You know, very nice kind helping people, but with the city you don't really know anyone. There's so many people that no one really cares about you know, you'll never see anyone, half the people there ever again.

They'll let them handle it. I feel like they just don't want to be bothered or bother anyone else, and interfere in a way. But then there's also people who are selfish. So it's a mix of the two.

It's kind of that sort of deal, but if it, if it comes to like medical or something, I feel like that should be kind of government funded and, you know, they kind of take care of it through taxes.

I mean, if you look at Facebook and Twitter and those kinds of platforms, there's no doubt that they've had a huge, profound impact on our lives. And the good thing is, is that with the, coming of a global world, we're now able to communicate with friends and family across the world instantly. I mean, I think that's wonderful.

So if you think about the number of people who, posted things online and, you know, comments and photographs and then as they get older, they suddenly regret that picture of themselves being up there. So, yeah, I think there's definite disadvantages. Also, it can just be used as a platform for people to get each other.

I mean, if you look at Facebook and Twitter and those kinds of platforms, there's no doubt that they've had a huge, profound impact on our lives. And the good thing is, is that with the, coming of a global world, we're now able to communicate with friends and family across the world instantly. I mean, I think that's wonderful.

But I just wonder if in reflection is, the disadvantages and, drawbacks to social media on outweighing the benefits. So if you think about the number of people who, posted things online and, you know, comments and photographs and then as they get older, they suddenly regret that picture of themselves being up there. So, yeah, I think there's definite disadvantages. Also, it can just be used as a platform for people to get each other. So attacking politicians or, bullies at, at school or celebrities based on something that they've said, you know? So yeah.

I went with some friends to see the celebrations there, and I could not believe the number of people there I saw that night. Most people went there to see the fireworks show and the crowd was enormous. People, they were just dancing, thinking, eating. They were just enjoying themselves, having the time of their lives. We went there at about 10 PMA few hours before midnight and we thought it would be busy, but nothing prepared us for such enormous crowd. And then we saw that the traffic was very slow as we approached the downtown area and the central bridge on the river. And as we got closer to the bridge, we could see that the police had sealed off several blocks or from the city. So we had to get out of our car and walk the rest of the way. And it took us up 15 to 20 minutes to reach our destination. And on our way as I got hungry, so I bought some food for myself. And eventually we arrived at the central square and there were so many people, the streets were filled and they were just, they were happy, they were enjoying. And then there was this fantastic lighting display which illuminated the iconic buildings and the whole sky was shining with fireworks. And then we all counted down to midnight and then returned to each other and wished each other a Happy New Year. And those were the prettiest fireworks I had ever seen in my life. And I'm really glad that I went. "

And I think the main reason for the high population density is people moving from smaller town and rural areas to bigger cities in search of employment and better living conditions, which creates a hustle and bustle in the cities and also because of political instability. And, you know, the streets in India are, they're very narrow and people keep building illegal shops and houses, which makes the area even more congested And due to improper enforcement of traffic laws, people bike, their people park their bikes and cars everywhere they want to. So I think it just increases the problem. "

I think it results in greater level of pollution, both the noise and the air, obviously there will be more motor vehicles which will result in more polluted air and more traffic noise because the traffic grows in our city. And another problem would be, I think, disease vulnerability, as during the time of Covid, I saw that it was so hard to maintain social distancing, especially in the markets if you're in India because of the enormous crowd everywhere and then there are other reasons. Lack of space also has a direct effect on your psychological and your physical growth as well. And then the, you know, exploitation of resources leads to inflation, and then there's lack of access to services like clean drinking water or sanitation, which leads to more diseases, increased disease rate in India. And I think the crime rate increases as well. "

These cities should provide better and safer housing for the people, as nearly 50% of the Mumbai's population lives in slums. I mean, they provide great plot for the feel, sorry for the poor and lovely wretches for the liberal writing, but nobody tries to improve the situation or provide a solution for it. The grave consequences of overpopulation needs to be addressed by the government. The government should take steps to regulate the crowd somehow, to disperse the population, even the roads. They're so narrow, and even when they try to build flyovers, a project like that takes at least 4 to five years to get over in India. And during that time, your population doubles, and then you need another fly over. And I think it's important to control the flow of people. And for that, you first need to understand where the flow is coming from. And I think in short term solutions, like during festivals, we celebrate many festivals throughout the year. So if you have proper planning on how to disperse crowd, you can award that . "

You will socialize more, you will interact with people more. And if you're a fan of pretty views as people in the big cities, the starve for full sky views, I think if you're living on the top apartments, you can enjoy beautiful views around the cities and obviously you will have the benefit of living a more peaceful life, because there will be no traffic noise or noise from the streets up there. And yeah, I think those and also living in such buildings is considered luxurious in India. So you have that and disadvantages would be, I think shifting moving in and moving out would be a great stress for you if you have a lot of furniture and I think another problem would arise if you suffer from a medical condition or medical emergency, like for instance, if one of your family member has high blood pressure or arthritis, then it's not favorable from for them to live in on the 20th floor at least. Other than that, I think slow elevators in some buildings are a problem if you have if you're in a hurry, you have to reach somewhere in time that could be a problem. Other than that, I think you will be fun. "

My next point is who prepared the meal? Well, I don't really know, but I can tell you about the restaurant. I remember it was very small and we sat outside in a lovely courtyard. There were plants and flowers all around and a nice cool breeze blowing. Anyway, I decided that the safest option for me to order was a salad. I wasn't really expecting very much, but when I took my first mouthful, I was in heaven. Like everything just tasted so fresh and full of flavour. The tomatoes were so sweet and juicy, the cucumbers crisp and the cheese creamy. When the waiter came to take our plates, he said that the secret was in the ingredients. All the vegetables had been grown in the family's garden, so that's why I will always remember that meal. "

And the good thing is, is that with the, coming of a global world, we're now able to communicate with friends and family across the world instantly. I mean, I think that's wonderful.

So if you think about the number of people who, posted things online and, you know, comments and photographs and then as they get older, they suddenly regret that picture of themselves being up there. So, yeah, I think there's definite disadvantages. Also, it can just be used as a platform for people to get each other.

I went with some friends to see the celebrations there, and I could not believe the number of people there I saw that night. Most people went there to see the fireworks show and the crowd was enormous. People, they were just dancing, thinking, eating. They were just enjoying themselves, having the time of their lives. We went there at about 10 PMA few hours before midnight and we thought it would be busy, but nothing prepared us for such enormous crowd. And then we saw that the traffic was very slow as we approached the downtown area and the central bridge on the river. And as we got closer to the bridge, we could see that the police had sealed off several blocks or from the city. So we had to get out of our car and walk the rest of the way. And it took us up 15 to 20 minutes to reach our destination. And on our way as I got hungry, so I bought some food for myself. And eventually we arrived at the central square and there were so many people, the streets were filled and they were just, they were happy, they were enjoying. And then there was this fantastic lighting display which illuminated the iconic buildings and the whole sky was shining with fireworks. And then we all counted down to midnight and then returned to each other and wished each other a Happy New Year. And those were the prettiest fireworks I had ever seen in my life. And I'm really glad that I went. "

And I think the main reason for the high population density is people moving from smaller town and rural areas to bigger cities in search of employment and better living conditions, which creates a hustle and bustle in the cities and also because of political instability. And, you know, the streets in India are, they're very narrow and people keep building illegal shops and houses, which makes the area even more congested And due to improper enforcement of traffic laws, people bike, their people park their bikes and cars everywhere they want to. So I think it just increases the problem. "

I think it results in greater level of pollution, both the noise and the air, obviously there will be more motor vehicles which will result in more polluted air and more traffic noise because the traffic grows in our city. And another problem would be, I think, disease vulnerability, as during the time of Covid, I saw that it was so hard to maintain social distancing, especially in the markets if you're in India because of the enormous crowd everywhere and then there are other reasons. Lack of space also has a direct effect on your psychological and your physical growth as well. And then the, you know, exploitation of resources leads to inflation, and then there's lack of access to services like clean drinking water or sanitation, which leads to more diseases, increased disease rate in India. And I think the crime rate increases as well. "

                "output": "I don't exactly know how to address this issue, but I think one solution could be building better infrastructure. These cities should provide better and safer housing for the people, as nearly 50% of the Mumbai's population lives in slums. I mean, they provide great plot for the feel, sorry for the poor and lovely wretches for the liberal writing, but nobody tries to improve the situation or provide a solution for it. The grave consequences of overpopulation needs to be addressed by the government. The government should take steps to regulate the crowd somehow, to disperse the population, even the roads. They're so narrow, and even when they try to build flyovers, a project like that takes at least 4 to five years to get over in India. And during that time, your population doubles, and then you need another fly over. And I think it's important to control the flow of people. And for that, you first need to understand where the flow is coming from. And I think in short term solutions, like during festivals, we celebrate many festivals throughout the year. So if you have proper planning on how to disperse crowd, you can award that . "

You will socialize more, you will interact with people more. And if you're a fan of pretty views as people in the big cities, the starve for full sky views, I think if you're living on the top apartments, you can enjoy beautiful views around the cities and obviously you will have the benefit of living a more peaceful life, because there will be no traffic noise or noise from the streets up there. And yeah, I think those and also living in such buildings is considered luxurious in India. So you have that and disadvantages would be, I think shifting moving in and moving out would be a great stress for you if you have a lot of furniture and I think another problem would arise if you suffer from a medical condition or medical emergency, like for instance, if one of your family member has high blood pressure or arthritis, then it's not favorable from for them to live in on the 20th floor at least. Other than that, I think slow elevators in some buildings are a problem if you have if you're in a hurry, you have to reach somewhere in time that could be a problem. Other than that, I think you will be fun. "

Also, parents should talk to their children and explain them the dangers associated with the internet so that way the kids will know what to do or what not to do.

I'm sure you've heard of a cat being stuck in a tree all the time, but it happened, so I got out of the car, assessed the situation, and there was no way I was reaching that cat. It was scared. It was so up, it was up high, nowhere could possibly climate so out of luck. A white van with the ladder on the top, so a work van was driving by. I waved it down. They pull over, which was a miracle. I'm surprised even pulled over, they were like, oh my goodness. Yeah, you can totally use our ladder. So I grabbed the ladder off the truck, propped it against a tree, climbed up the ladder, grabbed the cat, and I'm telling you, when this cat saw me and I put my hands on it, this thing freaked out. It scratched me up and down my arms, It, it tried biting me. It was, it was just freaking out. I wasn't mad at it, but you know, it hurt, it hurt pretty bad. Grabbed his cat, took it down the tree. I handed it to the lady. Oh my gosh, thank you. You know, she was very thankful for the help. Yeah, honestly it, it was just heartwarming to be honest. I think that's why I still remember it. "

You know, someone, they know someone else, and then it's just kind of a small loop because there's not many people, right? You could go to the, you could walk by your neighbor's house and see them leaving to go to the store, right? You can ask them, hey, can you bring me some eggs when you're at the store and bring it back? Sure, you know, they'll come back, bring you some eggs. It's kind of like that close, close friends neighbor idea, I guess you could say behind it, everyone knows everyone. You know, very nice kind helping people, but with the city you don't really know anyone. There's so many people that no one really cares about you know, you'll never see anyone, half the people there ever again.

They'll let them handle it. I feel like they just don't want to be bothered or bother anyone else, and interfere in a way. But then there's also people who are selfish. So it's a mix of the two.

It's kind of that sort of deal, but if it, if it comes to like medical or something, I feel like that should be kind of government funded and, you know, they kind of take care of it through taxes.

I mean, if you look at Facebook and Twitter and those kinds of platforms, there's no doubt that they've had a huge, profound impact on our lives. And the good thing is, is that with the, coming of a global world, we're now able to communicate with friends and family across the world instantly. I mean, I think that's wonderful. And also just for things like birthdays, that's really handy to have as well, just to be updated with things like that. But I just wonder if in reflection is, the disadvantages and, drawbacks to social media on outweighing the benefits. So if you think about the number of people who, posted things online and, you know, comments and photographs and then as they get older, they suddenly regret that picture of themselves being up there. So, yeah, I think there's definite disadvantages. Also, it can just be used as a platform for people to get each other. So attacking politicians or, bullies at, at school or celebrities based on something that they've said, you know? So yeah. And then there's the playing around with our personal information, to manipulate political elections. I mean, that is frightening. "

She worked very hard to make her ends meet and it goes without saying that she made many sacrifices for it. It didn't tell her from enjoying her life or getting involved in all the voluntary activities. She always helped others, and that's what she did, and I'm really proud of her, and I respect her for that. She is a very special character, she is so generous and kind and always giving at many times I have asked her for help. She always listened to be and she went out of her way to make sure that I was okay. Besides this, when I was young, she used to wait for me when I came back from school and she also helped me with my homework. Still today considering her age, she still helps us, my parents are out for long as because of their work commitments, but she still cooks for us. How can I not admire her?

As I said earlier I'm really interested in art and so even though I had no real desire to go to Islam, I was totally captivated by all the beautiful buildings and the wonderful arts and crafts that were available there. The Blue Mosque was my favorite building. From the outside it looks just like a typical Ottoman mosque, but inside it is quite startling. The large windows with the light reflecting on the exquisite blue tiles made it just breathtaking. I asked one of the guides, about the tiles and she told me that they were from and that they are still made today. When we left the Blue Mosque, we walked down a pedestrian lane full of shops, including some in one of the shops, the owner told us that the tiles were made in ethnic. Anyway, one of the tiles really caught my eye actually it sang to me, it was of fish, 4 big fish and lots of little ones, all in different shades of green. I really, really, really wanted it, but when we asked the price, it was very high, something like 300 American dollars. Obviously I knew we could negotiate, but it seemed such a high price that we just left the next night we went out for my birthday meal just as we were finisheding the dessert, the waiter came over and handed me the most beautifully wrapped gift I knew at once, because it was very heavy, that it was the fish style.

                "output": "Well, I think, as with everything, it depends on the person and the gift. When a grandchild makes something for their grandparents, like a bookmark or a playpot that they've made at school, then obviously their grandparents will treasure it.

But when it's adults making things, it has to look like the present is a proper present rather than something they've made just because it's cheaper. Of course, the thought still counts, and in many ways, our time now is more important or precious than than money. So if somebody has spent a lot of time making a gift, it will mean a lot.

Children these days are spoilt and they get too many gifts, so the more gifts they get, the less they value them. Adults, on the other hand, generally have the resources to buy things for themselves, so if they really want something, they can buy it.

But, if we have found the perfect gift for someone we love and we know it's going to make them happy, well then this will really fill our hearts with joy. Similarly, if someone receives a gift of something that they don't really want or they consent that it has been bought out of haste, then this isn't really going to make them feel that good.

We had a few days holiday from work and we decided to fulfill my husband's dream. As I said earlier I'm really interested in art and so even though I had no real desire to go to Islam, I was totally captivated by all the beautiful buildings and the wonderful arts and crafts that were available there. The Blue Mosque was my favorite building. From the outside it looks just like a typical Ottoman mosque, but inside it is quite startling. The large windows with the light reflecting on the exquisite blue tiles made it just breathtaking. I asked one of the guides, about the tiles and she told me that they were from and that they are still made today. When we left the Blue Mosque, we walked down a pedestrian lane full of shops, including some in one of the shops, the owner told us that the tiles were made in ethnic. Anyway, one of the tiles really caught my eye actually it sang to me, it was of fish, 4 big fish and lots of little ones, all in different shades of green. I really, really, really wanted it, but when we asked the price, it was very high, something like 300 American dollars. Obviously I knew we could negotiate, but it seemed such a high price that we just left the next night we went out for my birthday meal just as we were finisheding the dessert, the waiter came over and handed me the most beautifully wrapped gift I knew at once, because it was very heavy, that it was the fish style. That's why I. "

                "output": "Well, I think, as with everything, it depends on the person and the gift. When a grandchild makes something for their grandparents, like a bookmark or a playpot that they've made at school, then obviously their grandparents will treasure it. For adults, I think it's a bit different. If people are going to give homemade gifts, then they need to be of really good quality. "

But when it's adults making things, it has to look like the present is a proper present rather than something they've made just because it's cheaper. Of course, the thought still counts, and in many ways, our time now is more important or precious than than money. So if somebody has spent a lot of time making a gift, it will mean a lot. But if someone has made some chutneys or pickles or some of the type of food, then it has to be edible and taste nice as well. "

What is important, I think, with a shopboard gift is that the person buying the gift should spend some time thinking about what the other person would really appreciate. It's no good husband going into a perfume shop and buying the first perfume he likes. He needs to see what perfume his wife is wearing that shows his wife that he's paying her attention. "

Children these days are spoilt and they get too many gifts, so the more gifts they get, the less they value them. Adults, on the other hand, generally have the resources to buy things for themselves, so if they really want something, they can buy it. Of course, this then makes present buying for adults much more difficult.

Well, I think most people get pleasure out of both, of course it depends, we may not get a lot of pleasure out of giving gifts to children who we know may not appreciate them. But, if we have found the perfect gift for someone we love and we know it's going to make them happy, well then this will really fill our hearts with joy. Similarly, if someone receives a gift of something that they don't really want or they consent that it has been bought out of haste, then this isn't really going to make them feel that good.

So that's really, really nice, the MIDI Mediterranean sea. So, good weather is always a nice thing. We were there in, summer. It has 30 to 35 degrees, really nice, not too, not too hot. We were quite lucky because usually they have like 40 degrees. They have really good food at a really good kitchen. It was a nice thing. So there was always different food in the afternoon, the breakfast was really good. Yeah, and they had a really nice pool area. So they had like three different pools, some for children and then pools that the, adults could use. That was really nice. And because I really like to go swimming, just standing up, going out of bed, going in a pool, that's really what I really enjoy. Yeah, and because close to the sea, we also were allowed to go fishing there. So they offered like fishing trips because I'm also fishing and jump family. I really enjoyed that. And what's also cool, they had a gym there in the, in the hotel, which is rather big. So, just standing up, going to the gym, training, maybe have a little swim in the pool and then get back to the family, have breakfast. That's really nice. And, they also had some bars there. I was not and not allowed to drink at the time, but, maybe if I would go there again, would have some fun drinking. But it was rather big hotel, so I would today, I would prefer a smaller hotel with less people. So it was like the disadvantage with this particular hotel. So yup, I would, I would prefer a smaller one, but it was really nice because what's really in the center of the of the island, so we're close to different historic cities, rotors and other islands to visit in, in Greece. So yeah, and as I, as I told you, the weather was perfect. So I would I would really like to go there again, not maybe in that particular hotel. "

Well, what are the sorts of things that are important when people are choosing a hotel? ",

So of course, the area where you want to travel to, what important sites are there, different cities, museums, cultural things to do? If it's close to the sea, if you have a maybe nice view from your room. So these are, first of all, thing to location the country, of course, that's maybe the first thing that you ask yourself, which country do I want to travel to. And the other thing, of course, then is the hotel itself. So how big is it? How many people are there? It's maybe more entertaining herself for little children where lots of people are, is it like, a very small one in the, in an old town of a city? "

So maybe that's why most people that go for like these, flat sharing platforms so that they kind of rent a private flat for a week or for two weeks for holidays because it's more personal because you're staying really in the old town because you don't have to stick to certain times for breakfast. So it's a little, little bit, you have your own time management, you don't have to stick to it and you have more, more privacy as well, maybe because you don't have to, I don't know, look at the other, visitors all the time staying with you for breakfast in the dining rooms are.

Actually, I don't really have to go to luxury hotels. I could say in a really normal hotel, important for me would of course be what city it is in a way it is how fast I can travel to the city center and to the sites that I want to see want to visit. So, staying in a luxury hotel can be cool or can, could be, can be interesting and really, really enjoyable for a few days.

So, if you, for example, a manager there in a really big hotel with lots of people staying there could of course promote and push or improve your career. So when you really have to deal with a lot of people, you have to manage, have a good overview over the whole hotel. I think that is really, really good. Good thing to learn multitasking there. The other thing is if you're, for example, a cook, so if you're really in a small hotel where you can really a work on, so in a five star hold to a four star hotel, you can really deliver good food that the customers appreciates or really you can concentrate on the, on the quality of the food, create something new, create something special, of course.

For example, if you're manager, then of course it's completely different because you have, less people, but you can also, if you're in a smaller hotel, you can concentrate in the people, you have really take care of them like, and a private person that kind of, advises them on their trip on the things to do. So you can really, get in touch with the customers. That's maybe one advantage in a really small hotel because you don't have to spend that much time on dealing with everything else. I know with the amount of people coming, the food, the cleaning, because everything's smaller can really concentrate and deliver bad a better, product in general. So everything would, there would be an improved quality maybe then a really big hotel. You don't have to deal with lots of people and I think that's very, very, very different because you can't really get in touch with them . "

So you have to, deal with lot lots of things at a time. So how many people are coming? How many are leaving? What's the staff doing? So the people that you have to, give the tasks to other tasks, okay, how do they, interact with each other? Is everything working, other people staying and do they have a room? Is the room free, is the room cleaned? What food do we offer the next weeks? What do we have to buy for that? The social activities, maybe that the hotel offer?

But at times when it was, when it was very important for her to put her food down and make things right for us, she wouldn't think even one step and would be the hard person that was needed to be. She has given me the independence to make choices of my own, live by the choices. And but at the same time, she was that one person who would help my hand and make me aware of the pros and the cons of the choices. If I would go ahead and make those.

It hasn't been open for long, but it's become really popular. Everything in there is beautiful. Whether you're looking for an item of furniture for the living room or an ornament or something nice for the garden, I would imagine the shop appeals more to women than men. Certainly when I go there, there are often more women inside looking alone while their husbands or partners stand outside waiting for them to come back out. I think people who like to be surrounded by beautiful things enjoy going there. It's also a great place to go if you want to buy someone a present. If I had the chance, I would buy everything on sale. The thing I like most about the shop is that the things itself are different to what you find in the chain stores. They're handmade and produced by local businesses. And so, you know, you're buying something that nobody else has. Oh, it also sells a lot of things that have been recycled. For example, you'll often find an older cupboard or wardrobe that's been sanded down and painted in lovely patterns that me get look very bright, bright and modern.

There are so many different kinds and it depends on your taste, which one you would like best. What makes Indian food special for me is all the spices used. I usually order a hot curry, a dish with the extra chill in it, The first few mouthfuls burn a bit of course, but you slowly get used to the heat.

We had a few days holiday from work and we decided to fulfill my husband's dream. As I said earlier I'm really interested in art and so even though I had no real desire to go to Islam, I was totally captivated by all the beautiful buildings and the wonderful arts and crafts that were available there. The Blue Mosque was my favorite building. From the outside it looks just like a typical Ottoman mosque, but inside it is quite startling. The large windows with the light reflecting on the exquisite blue tiles made it just breathtaking. I asked one of the guides, about the tiles and she told me that they were from and that they are still made today. When we left the Blue Mosque, we walked down a pedestrian lane full of shops, including some in one of the shops, the owner told us that the tiles were made in ethnic. Anyway, one of the tiles really caught my eye actually it sang to me, it was of fish, 4 big fish and lots of little ones, all in different shades of green. I really, really, really wanted it, but when we asked the price, it was very high, something like 300 American dollars. Obviously I knew we could negotiate, but it seemed such a high price that we just left the next night we went out for my birthday meal just as we were finisheding the dessert, the waiter came over and handed me the most beautifully wrapped gift I knew at once, because it was very heavy, that it was the fish style. That's why I. Well, he's good at remembering my birthday and our anniversary, so he does usually buy me something nice then. But he doesn't just buy a present out of the blue. "

                "output": "Well, I think, as with everything, it depends on the person and the gift. When a grandchild makes something for their grandparents, like a bookmark or a playpot that they've made at school, then obviously their grandparents will treasure it. For adults, I think it's a bit different. If people are going to give homemade gifts, then they need to be of really good quality. "

Of course, the thought still counts. And in many ways, our time now is more important or precious than than money. So if somebody has spent a lot of time making a gift, it will mean a lot, but if someone has made some chutneys or pickles or some of the type of food, then it has to be edible and taste nice as well.

What is important, I think, with a shopboard gift is that the person buying the gift should spend some time thinking about what the other person would really appreciate. It's no good husband going into a perfume shop and buying the first perfume he likes. He needs to see what perfume his wife is wearing that shows his wife that he's paying her attention. "

But, if we have found the perfect gift for someone we love and we know it's going to make them happy, well then this will really fill our hearts with joy. Similarly, if someone receives a gift of something that they don't really want or they consent that it has been bought out of haste, then this isn't really going to make them feel that good.

We had a few days holiday from work and we decided to fulfill my husband's dream. As I said earlier I'm really interested in art and so even though I had no real desire to go to Islam, I was totally captivated by all the beautiful buildings and the wonderful arts and crafts that were available there. The Blue Mosque was my favorite building. From the outside it looks just like a typical Ottoman mosque, but inside it is quite startling. The large windows with the light reflecting on the exquisite blue tiles made it just breathtaking. I asked one of the guides, about the tiles and she told me that they were from and that they are still made today. When we left the Blue Mosque, we walked down a pedestrian lane full of shops, including some in one of the shops, the owner told us that the tiles were made in ethnic. Anyway, one of the tiles really caught my eye actually it sang to me, it was of fish, 4 big fish and lots of little ones, all in different shades of green. I really, really, really wanted it, but when we asked the price, it was very high, something like 300 American dollars. Obviously I knew we could negotiate, but it seemed such a high price that we just left the next night we went out for my birthday meal just as we were finisheding the dessert, the waiter came over and handed me the most beautifully wrapped gift I knew at once, because it was very heavy, that it was the fish style. That's why I. "

When a grandchild makes something for their grandparents, like a bookmark or a playpot that they've made at school, then obviously their grandparents will treasure it.

But when it's adults making things, it has to look like the present is a proper present rather than something they've made just because it's cheaper. Of course, the thought still counts, and in many ways, our time now is more important or precious than than money. So if somebody has spent a lot of time making a gift, it will mean a lot. But if someone has made some chutneys or pickles or some of the type of food, then it has to be edible and taste nice as well. "

What is important, I think, with a shopboard gift is that the person buying the gift should spend some time thinking about what the other person would really appreciate. It's no good husband going into a perfume shop and buying the first perfume he likes. He needs to see what perfume his wife is wearing that shows his wife that he's paying her attention. "

Children these days are spoilt and they get too many gifts, so the more gifts they get, the less they value them. Adults, on the other hand, generally have the resources to buy things for themselves, so if they really want something, they can buy it. Of course, this then makes present buying for adults much more difficult.

Well, I think most people get pleasure out of both, of course it depends, we may not get a lot of pleasure out of giving gifts to children who we know may not appreciate them. But, if we have found the perfect gift for someone we love and we know it's going to make them happy, well then this will really fill our hearts with joy. Similarly, if someone receives a gift of something that they don't really want or they consent that it has been bought out of haste, then this isn't really going to make them feel that good.

It hasn't been open for long, but it's become really popular. Everything in there is beautiful. Whether you're looking for an item of furniture for the living room or an ornament or something nice for the garden, I would imagine the shop appeals more to women than men. Certainly when I go there, there are often more women inside looking alone while their husbands or partners stand outside waiting for them to come back out. I think people who like to be surrounded by beautiful things enjoy going there. It's also a great place to go if you want to buy someone a present. If I had the chance, I would buy everything on sale. The thing I like most about the shop is that the things itself are different to what you find in the chain stores. They're handmade and produced by local businesses. And so, you know, you're buying something that nobody else has. Oh, it also sells a lot of things that have been recycled. For example, you'll often find an older cupboard or wardrobe that's been sanded down and painted in lovely patterns that me get look very bright, bright and modern.

But at times when it was, when it was very important for her to put her food down and make things right for us, she wouldn't think even one step and would be the hard person that was needed to be. She has given me the independence to make choices of my own, live by the choices. And but at the same time, she was that one person who would help my hand and make me aware of the pros and the cons of the choices. If I would go ahead and make those.

There are so many different kinds and it depends on your taste, which one you would like best. What makes Indian food special for me is all the spices used. I usually order a hot curry, a dish with the extra chill in it, The first few mouthfuls burn a bit of course, but you slowly get used to the heat.

It hasn't been open for long, but it's become really popular. Everything in there is beautiful. Whether you're looking for an item of furniture for the living room or an ornament or something nice for the garden, I would imagine the shop appeals more to women than men. Certainly when I go there, there are often more women inside looking alone while their husbands or partners stand outside waiting for them to come back out. I think people who like to be surrounded by beautiful things enjoy going there. It's also a great place to go if you want to buy someone a present. If I had the chance, I would buy everything on sale. The thing I like most about the shop is that the things itself are different to what you find in the chain stores. They're handmade and produced by local businesses. And so, you know, you're buying something that nobody else has. Oh, it also sells a lot of things that have been recycled. For example, you'll often find an older cupboard or wardrobe that's been sanded down and painted in lovely patterns that me get look very bright, bright and modern.

It's quite new building, only a few years old, but already it has become an important landmark because it's really unusual in its appearance. The first thing, you notice is that it leans over to one side. It's like the building in Italy, the leaning Tower of Pisa. Only that building is leaning because it's too old. This one is leaning because it was the architect's design actually. It's very strange. It's a skyscraper, it's very modern looking, a really cutting edge design, you know, it doesn't really have any sharp corners. It has lots of curves and it is all glass on the outside. Okay, moving on to what it's used for. Well, there is a hotel inside and maybe some apartments too, and I think there are some offices as well, but I'm not exactly sure. Finally, the reason why I like it is, well, I guess it's because it's unique, it's special. Also I'm interested in architecture, especially modern architecture, and I'm quite fascinated by how the building stays up. I mean, it doesn't fall down, I think it's because the building has a steel frame, and I heard it also has a very deep foundations, so, if you visit my city I'd recommend that you see this building that's all and chilly.

I think cities will get denser than they are now. I mean, there'll be more people living in the same area to cope with this. I think homes will get smaller and perhaps taller in order to fit more people in the major cities in my country. This has already happened but 50 years from now, I think most cities and towns will be the same. Very intense. "

And I really enjoy doing that because it was a tradition and I did it with my mom. So we, started in November and we started making Christmas carts for all the friends and acquaintances that sent us a cart the year before. They didn't send us a cart the year before, we usually didn't send them one back. And it was quite difficult in the beginning because it's very nitty gritty, small work, but, it got better as I got older. And I think we kept doing it until I was about 13 years old. And the best reason for doing it was really just to spend time with my mom with Christmas music in the back. And, it was always fun seeing the new kinds of cars that they brought out that year. So it was usually, it was some kind of animals, some kind of birds or or puppies or whatever. And it was a lot of fun actually just spending some quality time together and having Christmas juices gonna back and cake in the oven and just spending a few hours doing something that was just ours.

You can walk out onto the street and usually on a high street and you can buy any kind of I item of clothing or a bowl or something along those lines. You can always get it.

As robots become more evolved, they'll definitely become more involved in the, in the making process, but I also think that people are going to lose their jobs over it.

One, it's a good thing to keep evolving and to keep making new things, including those robots, but it will get make a lot of people lose their jobs, which also isn't great. "

She has her own company named as Purple Blue and her company makes personalized clothing. And I want to work with her because she's very persistent and hard work. I had seen her burning midnight oil. I remember very clearly when I was in, I would say 8th or 9th standard at that time, I went at her place and at that time, she was, she was very busy with her work because at that time there was a power cut in her factory and she was producing hundred tshirts by her hand. She was personalizing it by her hand because there was no electricity. So everyone was, everyone was consumed in that task. So at that time, I saw dedication in her and her people to complete the order. So at that time, I was very influenced and moved by her. So at that point only I decided to work with her. I, I think I, it would be very lucrative, not only for her, but also for me to work with her because I had, I have some innovative ideas how company only produces personalized clothing. So I would like to introduce some accessories, watches and other things, that would, create, and expand her business. More and more people would like to, buy more and more of personalized stuff because I think nowadays it is entrenched to have your name on your thing. So that is why I wanted to work with her in her company.

Part 1 Talking about creativity Part 2, an object with many uses. Part 3, creativity and problem solving. Important vocabulary is underlined in the subtitles. Check the definitions in the video description below. Now watch and learn. Welcome to the speaking section of the IELTS exam. My name is Adrian. I will be your examiner for this part of the test. Let's begin. May I see your identification? What is your full name? For part 1, I will ask you a couple of questions to get to know you better and some questions on a general topic. Do you work or study study? What is your favorite activity activity? Let's talk about celebrations. Do you like to celebrate birthdays and other events? What is your favorite celebration and why? Who do you usually celebrate with. Where do you go to celebrate certain events? Up the way people celebrate these days changed, changed compared to a generation ago ago. If you could make a new celebration, what would that be? That is the end of part 1. We will now continue with part 2. An important tip for part 1 to get those high band scores is to think about synonyms and ideas related to the topic of part 1. As soon as the examiner says, let's talk about, in this case, celebrations, the candidate to think about festivals, holidays, new year's birthdays, weddings, aid the Wali, Christmas, Hanukkah, and much, much more. In this way, inviting good answers with lots of details. And you can practice this in our weekly live classes on our YouTube channel. Just make sure to subscribe and hit that bell button to get notification occasions. Then you too will be able to come up with great answers and great ideas, just like when the examiner asks if you could make a new celebration, what would it be? And the candidate answers. If I had the chance, I would make a day to celebrate animals. Now let's continue. For this part, I will show you a card with some questions, you will have one minute to read these questions, Think about your answers. Then you will have one to two minutes to speak. You can take notes in the one minute preparation time if you wish you have some note paper and your pencil in front of you, talk about an object with many uses, your one minute preparation time begins now. Your one minute preparation time is up. Please begin speaking. Your time is up. Stop there. Please put your note paper to the side, turn it over as well as the pencil. And now I will ask you a question related to your response and some questions connected to the topic of part 2. A very important tip for part 2 is to take time during the one minute preparation to come up with at least two or three possible choices for the question. In this case, the Q card is asking about an object with many uses, so the candidate should come up with several different options such as scissors, pencils, hair clip, and of course the A four piece of paper, in this way giving the opportunity to make the best choice when thinking about a piece of paper. There are so many different uses, just like in this part to response. A common mistake is that candidates think of one idea and realize too late that it's either difficult to talk about there's not a lot of information or it's simply not the right answer. Make sure to think of at least 2 to 3 ideas for the Part 2 Q card and choose the best 1. Then take your notes and think about your first sentence. Now let's continue.

The questions in this test are designed to simulate the aisle speaking test. Let's start, What's your first name, please? My name's Jedediah, thanks Jedediah. At the beginning of the Ielts test, you need to provide some identification, usually a passport, but as this is a practice test, there's no need for this today Are you ready to begin? Yeah, let's go. Well, let's talk about the weather where you live. What is the weather like where you live? So I live in Melbourne and currently it's very hot. We are coming into the summer now, and so the weather's changing. It was really cold just a couple weeks ago, I had to have huge jackets on, but now I'm just wearing this, It's not a hoodie, but it's just a pullover cardigan. And I think it's pretty hot. I'm like sweating. So, but yeah, it's a good day. And do you like this kind of weather? I do, yeah, because, it's reminiscent of where I come from. So I come from Myanmar, it's very hot and humid. And so I'm naturally acclimatized to, generally warmer weathers. So when I'm in Melbourne and it's the winter, I usually get very cold and I have many layers on. So when it's warmer, I feel, I feel at home, I feel at ease. I feel a little bit uncomfortable because of the sweat, but that's just natural to me, I guess. "

I'm really impressed with his language. I'm impressed with his fluency. He is, you know, a really wonderful candidate to watch. There are a couple of things that I just want to point out. If you watched one of our videos with rommy, you will notice that it's quite common nowadays for young people to, at the end of the sentence when they're trying to make this natural conclusion, they might say things like, so, yeah, or, but yeah, and that's their way of ending the, sentence or the paragraph that they're talking about. You don't do it at the end of every sentence, but kind of this block of text or these ideas that you have right at the end, you might say something like that at one point he talked about wearing kind of a hoodie or a cardigan and I don't think that he quite got the right word there. The thing that he's wearing is probably more of a sweater or a jumper, and he didn't come up with either those words. But I don't think the examiner would pick up on that. That's just for your benefit. You know, you could talk about a hoodie, a hoodie has a hood. What I'm wearing today is a sweater or a jumper and a cardigan actually fastened in the middle with buttons or even a zip. So he didn't quite choose the right word there. He also said I naturally acclimatized to something. He's naturally acclimatized to the weather, and he also said he feels at home or he feels at ease. Really flexible language, great level of vocabulary here, great start. The thing that he's wearing is probably more of a sweater or a jumper, and he didn't come up with either those words.

                "output": "and have you ever seen the snark? I have actually, when I was a kid, we, me and my parents lived here in Melbourne. And so we went on a trip to Mount Gambia, I think it was, and so that's like a mountain with like snow on the top and it's like a tourist, destination. You can go skiing and stuff like that. So that's the first and only time I've seen snow. I've got to say, it's a little bit different from how it looks like in the movies, in a real life because a lot of a lot of the snow melts that it's like muddy and it's like brownish. So it's not as pleasant as in the movies. But yeah, I did definitely enjoy it. "

                "input": "Notice again he finishedes his paragraph with So, yeah, it's a really nice and natural feature of language. So if you can use it properly, then you could think about using it. The thing that I love about Jed is that he gives these great stories. It's like he's prepared for the question and in reality, he has no idea before the test what the question is that's coming. He's not prepared, but he has this really great ability to just talk and flow and give us many details. He tells stories. He talked about a time when he went away with his parents. I loved that he had some really nice language when he talked about, things which were, it was muddy and brownish, we used the word ish at the end of a sentence. That means a little bit so the snow could be brownish, which means a little bit brown. He also said and stuff like that, which was, was kind of giving an example that he didn't, he wasn't able to think of a specific example. And so we often use some stuff like that, which is, which is great. He used grammatically complex sentences, like when I was a kid. Remember that if you want to reach this band 7 or band 8, you have to have a variety of different types of complex sentences. So do bear that in mind when you're thinking about your answer. And the final thing that I want to point out is he said that's the first and only time that I've ever seen seen the snow. I like this phrase, the first and only, so really excellent example of an answer. The only thing that I would say is that in the test, it may be that the examiner interrupts you if you speak a little bit too much in your part 1. And we do find that that some students comment that when they took the test, the examiner stopped you after kind of one or two sentences. And that does happen during the test. It depends on the examiner. Ma, in this case, Marie allowed Jed to expand and talk more. And I just love Jed's answers, they're so phenomenal.

In Myanmar we haven't, sort of implemented, cardless technology as much as here in Melbourne. So if I'm in Myanmar I'll pay for everything with cash. But in Melbourne I just pay by card because it's so much easier. I have my card on my phone. So I don't have to carry my wallet around. And so I just pay by phone. So yeah. "

If you're gonna be using it at the end of every SEC section, just be careful cause the examiner might pick up that you're forcing that into your speech. He used more grammatically compared complex sentences. He said, if I'm in Myanmar, so that we've had a when sentence and then we maybe have an if sentence. He also said, it depends where I am.

I could spend it on video games, but, my dad always taught me that like you don't take or spend what's not yours. So I handed it into, lost property, in high school.

So I vividly remember, or I remember vividly when something happened. Then he talked about handing something in to lost property and those are some great, you know, high level pieces of Lexus there to hand something in is a phrasal verb, great collocation. And lost property is a collocation of two words which fit together. Lost property is where you find things that you have lost. So two different types of collocation, their ones a phrase of verb and one's kind of a noun phrase. So you can, you can take that and try to use that type of language in your speaking. ",

So I just chuck them in my pocket and then the pad and my trousers going to wash or something and I lose, I lose coins, I, you lose a lot of coins. And when I was in high school this one time I dropped my wallet and that was huge for me because like I'm big into saving. I was always big into saving.

Hey, just in terms of language, I have to say that this section was incredible in terms of the variety of different language that the Jed used and there's so many pieces of, of language that you could learn from here. Let's have a look at a couple together now the first one was that at the beginning of the sentence, the examiner asked, or the beginning of the section, the examiner asked, have you ever lost any money? Now? Jed answered definitely, and he put some emphasis on there, and that's one way of actually saying yes without saying yes. So think about that if you really want to make it clear to the examiner that your answer is yes, you can say definitely. So that's, a really good feature there. He also used the word cause, cuz, which is the shortened form of because he used cause a couple of times and this is an example of a pronunciation feature where we are contracting words and using the short form of it and it is absolutely okay to use these contractions in the speaking test. It's not a form formal exam. The speaking section of the exam is not formal, so you are encouraged if you can to use natural features of pronunciation and one of those is the contraction from because to cause he also said I was big into saving I was big into saving and that means that he was passionate about it. It's something that he really enjoyed doing. You can say that I'm big into football. I'm big into tennis and that means that I'm very passionate about it to be big into something and finally he concludes the sentence and he said it is what it is, it is what it is and that just means kind of you just have to accept it. And he lost his wallet, he lost the money in his wallet and he said, well, it is what it is, and at least I got my wallet back, so many nice features there, great job Jed.

                "output": "Now let's think about the topic of horses, do you like horses? I love horses, I think horses are great. I've always wanted to own a horse, but I haven't had, well, I mean the financial means, but also like a place where like the horse could, you know, live a good life, I guess, you know, run around, excess highs and things like that. I love it when I go back to Chin State and I see horses. I've ridden them a couple of times. I'm not very good at it. But yeah, and, it's also interesting, sort of looking at and like being next to a horses in different regions of the world. So like Myanmar, our horses are much shorter, I guess like our people, I guess I'm pretty short. But when you come into the, when you come into Australia and like to Melbourne, the policemen, dismounted police. So they ride horses and their horses are huge.

And in this section Jed gave quite a long answer. He gave lots of descriptions and there were some features of his pronunciation where he went up or he went down really naturally. And I just love listening to his his answers. They're so good, they're so well rounded, completely unprepared, but he has a great ability to answer questions. Let's listen more. ",

So, in state, we do have horses, primarily because, until recently roads were very underdeveloped, so you needed horses and carts to go around like ox drawn carts and things like that. So we did have a lot of horses and I have ridden a horse, but like not by myself. You know, I have like the train person next to me and like pulling the horse. But yeah, that's about it. And when was this? This was before I came to Australia, so that would have been about five years ago, I think. Yeah, so it's been a while and would you like to ride a horse in the future? Yes hundred percent. Once I have a good Korean I'm hoping I'll run into lots of money in the future. Then I plan to, either have my own horse or like adopt one and have someone take care of it for me and I just, I just really like the idea of having owning a horse. I guess it's like a childhood like dream. I guess like a lot of girls, like, I don't know, not the only girls, a lot of people when their children dream of like having a pony and stuff. For me, it's like a big stallion that I can ride into battle or something like that. Yeah. "

            {
                "input": "so there's been a few questions that we've listened to Jed, and he had some great Lexus. He's talked about mounted police. Mounted police are the police who sit on horse. They are mounted on top of a horse, which is great language, he said before I came to Australia, so that's grammatical complexity. He goes, so that would have been five years ago and he slowed down his speech when he said that because he's looking, he's trying to think of how many years. And that's a feature of pronunciation by changing the rhythm or the speed of of his speech. Good work. And he also said rather than just yes, when, would you like to ride a horse in the future? I think the examiner asked that question and he said yes, 100 percent. And that's showing that, again, we could use the word definitely or absolutely. You could say absolutely or definitely. In this case, he said yes, 100 percent. So adding those extra little pieces of information or P words and phrases will really help you push your lexical resource mark .

Now, I would like you to talk about a time when you felt excited about an event. Remember, you have one to two minutes for this, so don't worry if I stop you. I'll tell you when the time is up. Can you start speaking now, please? Yeah, so I remember this very vividly, but it was my 18th birthday. I think a lot of people would talk about the 18th birthday, but, for me, it was really special because, my grandparents lived in a different state to me, and so we only got to see them once a year. But for my 18th birthday, my parents sort of threw me a party, I guess, but it wasn't really a party because it wasn't like adolescence and like people my age, but it was just like an extended family gathering, I guess. And it was very special to me because in my culture, we had, we didn't have much food, back, not even 100 years ago. And so meat was very special. And so we have this culture of when we're happy, we slaughter an animal, and then we invite the family, and then we have a feast together. And so it's really special to me. And so, it wasn't just so we go from like chickens to like a pig to like a cow in order of like, I guess like how happy we are, and stuff like that. And so like, my parents had slaughtered a pig. And so that was like huge for me. It's like, wow, you know, I'm finally becoming an adult. Like, I get to see all of my extended family together and my grandparents were coming down. And so it was really, really cool. We had, the birthday and, the birthday party. And because we're, we're chin, we're primarily Christian. So it was a very Christian birthday party. Guess there was a lot of praying going on. And, I had all of my uncles and, from both sides of the family, sort of pray over me and I was like kneeling and they will put their hand on me and pray over me. And I was like a really special experience because it was like, as I transition into adulthood, I, I sort of felt like my family were there supporting me through that transition. And that's what made me so excited because it's like a lot of people, oh, perfect, thank you. "

He talked about slaughtering a pig, he used words like adulthood, so rather than just saying, when I became an adult, he said something like as I moved into adulthood, which is a different way, to paraphrase way of saying it, and that's showing variety of, of language. I'm thoroughly impressed by Chad and at the moment because he's not made any mistakes apart from the jumper mistake, which I think will let him off. He is stuck at this band 9, he has amazing fluency, fantastic range of grammar with no mistakes, wonderful vocabulary with a range of words, top notch and his pronunciation is effortless. No mistakes, no problems. A VA, a variety of different tones and speed, just really, really good. And I think I think students like yourself can learn Lawton, jedd has never kind of, he's not lived in an English speaking country for all his life. He moved to, to Australia where they speak English. So this shows that you can, if you want, you know, improve your English if you, if that's what you need. And Jed doesn't come from a family with lots of resources. Actually, I think Jed's family comes from a very working class family. He's saved the money to move to Australia and he works really hard. I know Jed and he spends a lot of his time helping other people and devoting his time voluntarily. And that's a great way to improve your English if you are investing your time to improve, that will hopefully reap some rewards. So big thumbs up to Jed so far. So big thumbs up to Jed so far. ",
                "output": "Part 3, I wanna stay on the topic of It site. What types of events do children get excited about? I think nowadays, especially a lot of bright, loud, colorful events. And that's why we see music festivals really taking off. And they took off in my home country as well. In high school, a lot of people would go to these massive festivals were like fire, like coming out, like loud music. And so I, not necessarily children too as well. I mean, like children, children's birthday parties are always very colorful, very loud. I've got, you've got like entertainers coming and things like that. So, yeah. "

                "input": "again, so, yeah, there's a piece of language in here that I want to focus on it, to take off. It's, you can take off a jumper and that's one way of using it as a frarasal verb. But the other ways he talked about festivals taking off and when something takes off, it can become popular. So a recent craze or a new sport has taken off in my country. So you can take off a jumper or a jacket, something can take off, it can become popular, and finally you can talk about an airplane taking off, which means leaving the ground as they start flying. So the airplane took off at 5 PM . ",
                "output": "and on what occasions do people feel both nervous and excited? I would probably say, in my personal experience, it's when you get your exam results, because, I was always a person that studied really hard, but was never fully satisfied with the amount of work I've done. So like when I go into an environment where I am about to sort of get my exam marks revealed to me. I'm like I'm always nervous, like, what if I do worse? Then I thought I would, or, but then it's like, you know, I did a lot of work. So like that's sort of validating to me. I'm, I could get a good mark. And so it's like both exciting and extremely nerve wrecking at the same time. "

                "input": "I don't know if you notice, but in this particular section Jed starts to use the word like quite a lot, which is a common word for people, for young people to use. He talks about, so it's like this. And it was like when I was like describing, so if you go back and play it again, you'll hear that he uses the word like it's a fill of phrase, which is used when people maybe are looking for ideas or explaining something. It means kind of, it was like a nice time. So it was kind of like is a common fill of phrase in English. He used it a lot here, but I don't think he overused it. And there's a lot of people who nowadays tend to overuse the word. Like, I think this would be at the kind of upper limit of how often I would advise using it. Just great answers, but I just noticed that in this particular section. Just great answers, but I just noticed that in this particular section. ",
                "output": "And what advice would you give to people if they were nervous about something? I mean, there's a lot of general, like very typical advice, like or count to 10 or like slow down your breathing and things like that. But my advice would be just, just no, like if you've prepared for whatever you're nervous about and like, I heard in this podcast, actually, it was a really interesting podcast. They said that if you're nervous about something, it's because you care about it, right? And so a lot of events that you care about, you would have prepared for. And so if you're prepared for the event and you're nervous about it, just sit in that moment and understand that, hey, this is really important to you, and that's why you're nervous about it. But you've prepared and you will do well. And so that sort of leads to a little bit of like confidence building up. And generally you do, you do a lot better if you're in that sort of mindset rather than like, oh, this is a huge event. I'm gonna mess it up or what ball. "

                "input": "I don't know if you notice that in this section, he used the word right twice, which is a rhetorical device. It's looking for this relationship between the speaker and the listener. It's checking that this, the person is listening and it's almost like this validation and, looking for something from the listener where you're saying, it was a great event, right? And using this right whi, which goes up at the end is looking for validation or looking for confirmation that the person is listening. It's a very common feature that native speakers use and Jed uses it perfectly, and I think it's a great feature of his language that brings us to the end of Jed's test. And I don't know about you, but it's such a pleasure to have Jed back. He brings so many ideas that you guys could work with. So if you do like what you hear, please give this video a thumbs up. If you've learned something from today's test, please give the video a like and a thumbs up, it really helps us, I don't think I need to tell you, but for all sections of Jed's test I'm going to award him a band 9. So fluentine coherence of band 9, grammatical range and accuracy, band 9, lexical resource band 9, and pronunciation band 9. Everything was top quality, really, really great example of an speaking test band 9, just not a native speaker, but he is of natives level now. He never started there. So what I want to say is that if you really want to improve, you can and jeddah's come, he's worked so hard to get here, he didn't go to a school which spoke English, he is put in all the hard work, so we need to give him a big round of applause. Yes, thank you guys for watching. I hope that was useful. I hope you enjoyed it.

                "output": "Hello and welcome to this practice exam conducted by aylest daily. My name is Maddie and I'm your practice aylest speaking examiner. The questions in this test are designed to simulate the ielt speaking test. Let's start What's your first name, please? My name's Jedediah, thanks Jedediah, At the beginning of the Ielts test, you need to provide some identification, usually a passport, but as this is a practice test, there's no need for this today. Are you ready to begin? Yeah, let's go. Well, let's talk about the weather where you live What is the weather like where you live? So I live in Melbourne and currently it's very hot, we are coming into the summer now and so the weather's changing. It was really cold just a couple weeks ago. I had to have huge jackets on, but now I'm just wearing this, It's not a hoodie, but it's just a pullover. And I think it's pretty hot. I'm like sweating. So, but yeah, it's a good day. And do you like this kind of weather? I do, yeah, because, it's reminiscent of where I come from. So I come from Myanmar, it's very hot and humid. And so I'm naturally acclimatized to, generally warmer weathers. So when I'm in Melbourne and it's the winter, I usually get very cold and I have many layers on. So when it's a warmer, I feel, I feel at home, I feel at ease. I feel a little bit UN uncomfortable because of the sweat, but that's just natural to me, I guess. Yeah, and have you ever seen the snow? I have, actually, when I was a kid, we, me and my parents lived here in Melbourne. And so we went on a trip to Mount Gambia, I think it was, and so that's like a mountain with like snow on the top and it's like the tourist destination. You can go skiing and stuff like that. So that's the first and only time I've seen snow. I've got to say it's a little bit different from how it looks like in the movies, in real life because a lot of a lot of the snow melts that it's like muddy and it's like brownish, so it's not as pleasant as in the movies. But yeah, I did definitely enjoy it. Well I'd like to move on to the topic of cash. Do you normally pay by cash or car? Well, it depends where I am in Myanmar, we haven't, sort of implemented, cardless technology as much as here in Melbourne, so if I'm in Myanmar I'll pay for everything with cash. But in Melbourne I just pay by card because it's so much easier. I have my card on my phone, so I don't have to, carry my wallet around. And so it's just paid by phone. So yeah, and have you ever found money, money in the street? I have, but not recently. So it was, I remember vividly when I was in high school, I saw $50 on the ground. And as a high school student, that was a lot of money. And so like, I could buy like lots of things. I could spend it on video games, but, my dad always taught me that like you don't take or spend what's not yours. So I handed it into, lost property in high school. Yeah, and I don't have any other memories of finding cash on the ground. And have you ever lost some money? Definitely I've lost a lot of money. I am not, I like to think of myself as a very organized person and I usually put all my cash into my wallet. But sometimes, I'll I'll just because of convenience and cause like in Melbourne, you use coins a lot. So I just chuck them in my pocket and then the pad and my trousers is going to wash or something and I lose, I lose coins. I'll lose a lot of coins. And when I was in high school this one time, I dropped my wallet and that was huge for me because like I'm big into saving. I was always big into saving. So I had all my savings in my wallet, dropped it at a shopping center in Melbourne. Wallet got to return my wallet, returned to lost property in the shopping mall, but all of the cash was taken out. So, yeah, it is what it is. Now let's think about the topic of forces. Do you like horses? I love horses, I think horses are great. I've always wanted to own a horse, but I haven't had, well, I mean the financial means, but also like a place where like the horse could, you know, live a good life, I guess, you know, run around, exercise highs and things like that. I love it when I go back to Chin State and I see horses. I've ridden them a couple of times. I'm not very good at it. But yeah, and it's also interesting, sort of looking at and like being next to a horses in different regions of the world. So like Myanmar, our horses are much shorter, I guess like our people, I guess I'm pretty short. But when you come into the, when you come into Australia and like to Melbourne, the policemen, dismounted police, so they ride horses and their horses are huge. They're like taller than me and they're very scary. Yeah, and have you ever ridden a horse? Oh, I have, yeah. So, in state, we do have horses, primarily because, until recently roads were very underdeveloped. So you needed horses and carts to go around like ox drawn carts and things like that. So we did have a lot of horses and I have ridden a horse, but like not by myself, you know, I have like the train person next to me and like pulling the horse. But yeah, that's about it. And when was this? This was before I came to Australia, so that would have been about five years ago, I think. Yeah, so it's been a while and would you like to ride a horse in the future? Yes hundred percent. Once I have a good Korean I'm hoping I'll run into lots of money in the future. Then I plan to, either to have my own home horse or like adopt one and have someone take care of it for me. And I just, I just really like the idea of having owning a horse Um's, I guess it's like a childhood like dream. I guess like a lot of girls like, no, not the only girls. A lot of people when their children dream of like having a pony and stuff. For me, it's like a big stallion that I can ride into battle or something like that. Yeah, part 2 in the next part of the test I'm gonna give you a topic and I would like you to speak for one to 2 minutes. You will have one minute to think about what you wanna say and I will give you a penance and paper to make some notes if you want. Exactly, exactly, here is your paper, here is your pen, you have one minute to prepare. Now, I would like you to talk about a time when you felt excited about an event. Remember, you have one to two minutes for this, so don't worry if I stop you. I'll tell you when the time is up. Can you start speaking now, please? Yeah, so I remember this very vividly, but, it was my 18th birthday. I think a lot of people would talk about the 18th birthday, but, for me it was really special because, my grandparents lived in a different state to me, and so we only got to see them once a year, but for my 18th birthday, my parents, sort of threw me a party, I guess, but it wasn't really a party because it wasn't like adolescents and like people my age, but it was just like an extended family gathering, I guess. And it was very special to me, because in my culture we had, we didn't have much food back, not even 100 years ago. And so meat was very, very special. And so we have this culture of when we're happy, we slaughter an animal, and then we invite the family, and then we have a feast together. And so it's really special to me. And so, it wasn't just so we go from like chickens to like a pig to like a cow in order of like, I guess like how happy we are, and stuff like that. And so like, my parents had slaughtered a pig. And so that was like huge for me. It was like, wow, you know, I'm finally becoming an adult. Like, I get to see all of my extended family together and my grandparents were coming down. And so it was really, really cool. We had, the birthday and, the birthday party. And because we're, we're chin, we're primarily Christian. So it was a very Christian birthday party. Guess there was a lot of praying going on. And, I had all of my uncles and, from both sides of the family, sort of pray over me and I was like kneeling and they will put their hand on me and pray over me. And I was like a really special experience because it was like, as I transition into adulthood, I, I sort of felt like my family were there supporting me through that transition. And that's what made me so excited because it's like a lot of people, oh, perfect, thank you. Part 3, I wanna stay on the topic of excitement. What types of events do children get excited about? I think nowadays, especially a lot of bright, loud, colorful events. And that's why we see music festivals really taking off. And they took off in my home country as well. In high school, a lot of people would go to these massive festivals were like fire, like coming out, like loud music. And so I, not necessarily children too as well. I mean, like children, children's birthday parties are always very colorful, very loud. I've got, you've got like entertainers coming in and things like that. So, yeah, and on what occasions do people feel both nervous and excited? I would probably say, in my personal experience, it's when you get your exam results. Because, I was always a person that studied really hard, but was never fully satisfied with the amount of work I've done. So like, like when I go into an environment where I am about to sort of get my exam marks revealed to me. I'm like I'm always nervous, like, what if I do worse? Then I thought I would or, but then it's like, you know, I did a lot of work. So like that's sort of validating to me. I'm, I could get a good mark. And so it's like both exciting and extremely nerve wrecking at the same time. And what advice would you give to people if they were nervous about something? I mean, there's a lot of general, like very typical advice, like or count to 10 or like slow down your breathing and things like that. But my advice would be just, just know like if you've prepared for whatever you're nervous about and like, I heard in this podcast, actually, it was a really interesting podcast. They said that if you're nervous about something, it's because you care about it, right? And so a lot of events that you care about, you would have prepared for, right? And so if you're prepared for the event and you're nervous about it, just sit in that moment and understand that, hey, this is really important to you and that's why you're nervous about it. But you've prepared and you will do well. And so that sort of leads to a little bit of like confidence building up. And generally you do, you do a lot better if you're in that sort of mindset rather than like, oh, this is a huge event. I'm gonna mess it up or whatever. Well, thank you. That is the end of this practice. Aisle speaking tests. Thank you for your time. "

In fact, in that short answer, she used 14 discourse markers, so she used the word originally, she used the word actually on two occasions to show the examiner that they might be surprised by this information. She used the word so to give herself time to think, and she used the word am in the same way she also said again, but this time as opposed to, and at the end of her answer, she said, yeah, to indicate that she had finisheded speaking.

All of these features of connected speech are very, very important for your pronunciation score. And of course, as a native English speaker, it's very easy for her.

I'd like to move on to the topic of jokes. Are you good at remembering jokes? No, I I'm not very good at remembering jokes. I'm not going to lie, something my dad always loved to tell jokes. And I think that because he loved jokes so much, I always became deterred from them, typical dead jokes. But yeah. And what type of jokes do you like? I think that I usually prefer the types of jokes that more like riddles where they have sort of a story to them. So you get invested in the story and it goes on for a while, and then you have the punch line at the end. That's sort of joke that I prefer, as opposed to the short, witty jokes. "

She needs to stop, she needs to pause, she needs to think sometimes she's not completely flawless in the way you would find when you're watching a TV show or a movie where the whole dialogue is scripted and the actors are repeating what they've learned. So in the real world English speaking is not as flawless as you see on TV, so what we see from Julia here is exactly what the examiner is looking for when someone's going to achieve a band 9. ",

And then for whatever topic that you're discussing, having that specific topic related language, that will show that you have a wide range is what gets you a high score. So if you've been learning special words for the IELTS test that you think are impressive and that will get you a high score, what you see from Julia's performance here is that that is not what the examiner is actually looking for.

I'll tell you when the time is up Can you start speaking now, please? Okay, so the first phone that I owned was when I was in your six. It was actually a gift from my godmother for my birthday, and it was a pink Nokia foot phone. And I remember when I first got it, I was so happy because it was my first phone and I could call and text my friends and it was really exciting. And the phone had a cool retro design, and so I loved my phone so much and I used it all the time. And then I remember as the iPhone came out, all of my friends in your six were getting iPhones, which was ridiculous now that I look back at it, but I remember being so jealous of all my friends who had this, these groovy cutting edge iPhones with touch screens. And I had my little cute retro Nokia. But I look back at it, and I almost wanna have a Nokia again now. I kind of miss my phone, because I think it was really nice to be able to focus just on contacting friends and I think that's what phones originally that's what their purpose was so you couldn't contact anyone from anywhere, and just stay in contact and connected with everyone. And I kind of miss that aspect. I think that phones are very convenient now, but I think there's almost too many things that you can do on a phone. So, yeah, I think it would always be nice to have the technology revert a little bit and go back in time a little bit, and get back to those, to those basics. Yeah, yeah. So I think that if I had my time again, I would have kept my original Nokia phone for as long as possible. And I'm glad that my parents did keep me with the same phone for the following, I think two or three years. So yeah, thank you, no worries. "

But then even though we couldn't see Maddie on camera, we're pretty sure she did something like this to indicate to Julia that the time wasn't up and she needed to stay speaking. And this shows us just how hard it really is to continue speaking on a topic for a full two minutes. So if it's difficult for a native English speaker in their own language, of course it's going to be challenging for you as well in a second language. So do lots of preparation for aisle speaking. Part 2, make sure you've prepared yourself by practicing many, many different topics, many different part 2 Q cards and getting comfortable with the note taking process in the one minute to make notes so that you can comfortably continue speaking for a full two minutes when you're in your eyes speaking test. ",
                "output": "Has our ability to communicate with each other improved over the last 50 years? I think this is an interesting question because I think that obviously it has with the increase of technology. So what I was saying before about how we can, we're gonna contact people, mobile phones, we can send messages, we can send photos, things like face time and video chat make it really accessible to contact people when you're not physically with them. Having said that, when you are physically with people, I think our ability to communicate has actually decreased because we lose those skills when we become so used to contacting people exclusively via technology, you do lose that capacity to have real meaningful connections face to face. So I think that that's definitely something, a way that our communication has actually, reduced. Yeah, and can body language help you communicate better? Yes, definitely. And this sort of flows on from that idea about face to face communication, because when obviously when you contact people through a phone or Syrian a computer, it's very difficult to sense that body language. So being in person and being able to read people's body language and. I would always prefer to have those sorts of conversations in person because I think it really is important to sort of connect with the other person in terms of seeing like visually how they're reacting, and be able to sort of match my reactions and my communication styles to how that other person is feeling so that you can both be on the same page and you can adjust because those things you just couldn't do via textical.

                "input": "right? So after listening to quite a few of Julia's part 3 answers, what we notice is that she's really good at developing them. She answers the question and then she goes into more detail, she never gives short answers. And then on the other side is she doesn't stay going on forever and ever so that the examiner has to interrupt her. Julia gives a nice amount of development, enough that the answer is strongly supported, and then she finishedes, waits for the next question, and starts again, again. ",
                "output": "And why is it important to understand how different cultures communicate? I think it's really important because as we've seen through the increase of technology, communication within a single culture can change so much over a period of time. So and so seeing how different cultures vary in terms of communication style, it just shows you that it's really, really necessary to appreciate and understand how those variations are sort of crucial to understanding the cultures, of course, but then also understanding communication self because there is such a vast variety and there is no right or wrong way. Thank you. That is the end of this practice I ought speaking test. Thank you. So Julia, how is that for you? That was good, I think I really liked the questions actually I thought it were really interesting topics. And I think it went pretty well. And did you find any of the questions hard? I actually found the gardening questions difficult, ironically, because I think it's difficult to elaborate on questions that are quite specific. So, yeah. And did you make any noticeable mistakes? Sort of went in circles and rambled on a little bit. But yeah, do you remember any of the questions? And if you do, can you remind us what they were because sometimes after an exam, it is really hard to remember what questions you were asked. To the best of my memory, the exam started with questions about my hometown and where I lived. That was followed by a question about whether or not I liked where I lived. I'm pretty sure. And then there were questions about if I had a garden, if I do gardening, and then if anyone I know does a lot of gardening, and I think that was followed by the question about, my first phone. And then after that was about communication styles and the importance of body language and whether or not we need to appreciate and accept and understand communication cells from different cultures. Oh yeah, well done. You just missed out on the jokes topic, which talked about jokes. Do you like jokes? What TV shows do you watch? And, what kind of jokes you actually like? Because. "

Fluency and Coherence is a band 9 lexical resource is a band 9, grammatical range and accuracy is a band 9, and of course, pronunciation is a band 9. Overall, band 9, great performance, but of course she's a native English speaker, so it is not that surprising if you are aiming for a high score yourself.

                "output": "Hello and welcome to this practice exam conducted by ield Staley. My name is Maddie and I am your practice ielt speaking examiner. The questions in this test are designed to simulate the ielt speaking. Let's start. What's your first name, please? Julia, Thanks Julia, are you ready to begin? Yes Anne, Let's talk about your hometown Do you live in a city, in a town or in the country? So originally I'm actually from Sydney, so Sydney is a coastal town, so it's near the beach, so a lot of things that you can do near the beach include swimming, you can go for walks, it's really lovely. I now actually live in Melbourne, so that's more of a city in urban town, so things that you can do are shopping, you can go walking again, but through the streets this time as a person in beach, both cities are lovely and I'm very happy. Yeah, what is the best thing about living where you live? I think that the best thing about where I'm living is its proximity to the city, so where I live is nice and close, public transport is really good, it's very easy to get around if I ever need to get something or I need to do something, it's really, really, really easy to do that. And I can usually get there in a really short period of time. Would you like to live somewhere, somewhere different? I would definitely love to live somewhere overseas, potentially France, because I'm learning French, so it would be lovely to be able to practice my French and experience another culture and get to know a whole new group of people. I think that would be really cool. I'd like to move on to the topic of jokes, Are you good at remembering jokes? No, I I'm not very good at remembering jokes. I'm not gonna lie. Something my dad always loved to tell jokes, and I think that because he loved jokes so much, I always became deterred from them. Typical dad jokes. But yeah, and what type of jokes do you like? I think that I usually prefer the types of jokes that more like riddles where they have sort of a story to them, so you get invested in the story and it goes on for a while and then you have the punch line at the end. That's sort of joke that I prefer, as opposed to the short, witty jokes. Do you enjoy watching comedy shows on TV? I do, I enjoy watching company shows on TV. I also actually went to a comedy show about two nights ago, which was really fun to watch really interesting to see, some people live speaking, definitely the standard with of comedy was very different between the professionals on comedy shows and a local comedy stand up competition. But nonetheless, it was really enjoyable. Now let's think about the topic of gardening. Do you have a garden where you live? I actually live in an apartment, so I don't have a garden, however we do have a large balcony and on the balcony we have lots of plants that is veggie garden. Most of the plants are in pots and it's quite nice because I have two dogs so they love to run around and frolic near the plants, I guess. And do you light gardening? I do like gardening actually, because we have the veggie patch, I really enjoy planting different vegetables. I often do this with my mom because she's very passionate about cooking and using different vegetables and herbs. So quite often I will help her out there. Yeah, and do you know anyone else who does a lot of gardening? My grandmother loves gardening, she has a really, really large property and there are lots of different plants and again, she has a veggie patch and she spends almost all day, every day out in the garden gardening, using all sorts of different tools and planting different vegetables. And similar to my mom, she likes to use the vegetables that she plants and that she grows and she uses them to cook, which is that, which I think is really cool. And would you like to have a big garden in the future? I think I would like to have a big garden in the future. There's something really nice about being around nature and around plants and again, that aspect of the veggie garden is something that I really like and I would like to incorporate that into my home when I'm older and in the future. Part 2 in the next part of the test I'm going to give you a topic and I would like you to speak on this for one to two minutes. You will have one minute to think about what you want to say and I will give you a pen and some paper to make notes if you want. Is that clear? So here is your pen and here is your paper. You have one minute to prepare. Thank you. Now, I would like you to talk about the first phone you had. Remember, you have one to two minutes for this, so don't worry if I stop you. I'll tell you when the time is up Can you start speaking now, please? Okay, so the first phone that I owned was when I was in your six. It was actually a gift from my godmother for my birthday, and it was a pink Nokia foot phone. And I remember when I first got it, I was so happy because it was my first phone and I could call and text my friends and it was really exciting. And the phone had a cool retro design, and so I loved my phone so much and I used it all the time. And then I remember as the iPhone came out, all of my friends in your six were getting iPhones, which was ridiculous now that I look back at it, but I remember being so jealous of all my friends who had this, these groovy cutting edge iPhones with touch screens. And I had my little cute retro Nokia. But I look back at it, and I always wanna have a Nokia again. Now I kind of miss my phone, because I think it was, it's really nice to be able to focus just on contacting friends and I think that's what phones originally that's what their purpose was so you couldn't contact anyone from anywhere. Just stay in contact and connected with everyone. And I kind of miss that aspect. I think that phones are very convenient now, but I think there's almost too many things that you can do on a phone. So yeah, I think it would always be nice to have the technology revert a little bit and go back in time a little bit and get back to those to those basics. Yeah, yeah. So I think that if I had my time again, I would have kept my original Nokia phone for as long as possible. And I'm glad that my parents did keep me with the same phone for the following, I think two or three years. So yeah, thank you, no worries. Now part 3, I want to stay on the topic of communication. Has our ability to communicate with each other improved over the last 50 years? I think this is an interesting question because I think that obviously it has with the increase of technology. So what I was saying before about how we can, you know, contact people, mobile phones, we can send messages, we can send photos, things like face time and video chat make it really accessible to contact people when you're not physically with them. Having said that, when you are physically with people, I think our ability to communicate has actually decreased because we lose those skills when we become so used to contacting people exclusively via technology, you do lose that capacity to have real, meaningful connections face to face. So I think that that's definitely something, a way that our communication has actually, reduced. Yeah, and can body language help you communicate better? Yes, definitely. And this sort of flows on from that idea about face to face communication, because when obviously when you contact people through a phone or through a computer, it's very difficult to sense that body language. So being in person and being able to read people's body language and, you know, get vibes, I guess from people, you could say it's really, really important. It's really difficult to achieve that through technology. And if you were having a difficult conversation with someone, would you prefer to have it over the phone or in person? I would always prefer to have those sorts of conversations in person because I think it really is important to sort of connect with the other person in terms of seeing like visually how they're reacting, and be able to sort of match my reactions and my communication styles to how that other person is feeling so that you can both be on the same page and you can adjust because those things you just couldn't do via text or call. And why is it important to understand how different cultures communicate? I think it's really important because as we've seen through the increase of technology communication within a single culture can change so much over a period of time. So and so seeing how different cultures vary in terms of communication style, it just shows you that it's really, really necessary to appreciate and understand how those variations are sort of crucial to understanding the cultures, of course, then also understand the communication itself because there is such a vast variety and there is no right or wrong way. Thank you. That is the end of this practice. I'll speaking test, thank you. So Julia, how is that for you? That was good, I think I really liked the questions actually I thought it were really interesting topics. And I think it went pretty well, and did you find any of the questions hard, I actually found the gardening questions difficult, ironically, because I think it's difficult to elaborate on questions that are quite specific. So, yeah. And did you make any noticeable mistakes? I think as opposed to grammatical mistakes, I think there were definitely a few times where I sort of went in circles and rambled on a little bit. But yeah, do you remember any of the questions? And if you do, can you remind us what they were because sometimes after an exam, it is really hard to remember what questions you were asked. To the best of my memory, the exam started with questions about my hometown and where I lived. That was followed by a question about whether or not I liked where I lived.

And then after that was about communication styles and the importance of body language and whether or not we need to appreciate and accept and understand communication cells from different cultures. Oh yeah, well done. You just missed out on the jokes topic, which talked about jokes. Do you like jokes? What TV shows do you watch? And, what kind of jokes you actually like?

That's okay. But it's better to say I like both chocolate and swimming because swimming is a noun. It's the Geron form.

Now when you're describing somebody, you need to use an adjective, so I am late, they are late, so there are a few girls who are always late. However, in natural spoken English, we would often contract the Who and the are. Together we would say who are or who are. There are many girls who are always late. So when you listen to it, it just sounds like who who are always like who are, can you hear the who are, I don't think Kiara said, whoa, she just said there are many girls who late.

Then she said I'm shopping. I feel like she's trying to be some sort of very fancy British person, shopping or it's a, a short off, you may find that people from very, very kind of posh backgrounds would say shopping, but most people nowadays would just say shopping.

And French is so difficult, especially when you're not familiar with the most of European language like German or anything like that. And especially for its tenses, like not like not similar with English, like it has about, more than 10 tenses. So it's really difficult to know how to like the variations of the verb. And also the structure of the sentence is different with English, especially when you have English in your mind, like to do translation is the biggest mistake to do French. And also like pronunciation is so difficult as well. But I mean, I know therefore every language, like if you're a not native speaker, pronunciation, it's a very big problem. But French, Italian is especially difficult is because they have some little sound with it. I don't know, tongue. And you probably need to wrote a tongue to do that. And it's so hard to do that. Our sound also, I start this course one year and ago, so I've already later a year and I could basically have conversations with people, but not really diffi difficult in depth, like conversations. And I decide to learn this language because, when I used to grow up in England, I have a lot of French friends like who study like in England, and they often do some small talks in French and really wanna understand what you're talking about.

So if you look at her final squid, say fluency and coherence between an eight and a 9, but I'm gonna give a 9 today. Grammatical range and accuracy 7. Lexical resource, probably an 8. And pronunciation, maybe an 8, because she makes these very kind of common and simple mistakes, so. But overall, really fantastic job. I think she's done a little bit better than her previous time.

                "output": "Hello and welcome to this practice mock exam conducted by eiles daily. My name is May and I'm your practice. I'll speaking examiner. The questions in this test are designed to simulate the aisle speaking test. Let's stop What's your first name please? My first name is Kiara at the beginning of the IELTS test, you need to provide some identification, but as this is a practice test, there's no need for this today. Are you ready to begin? Yes, I want to begin by talking about your childhood, where did you grow up? I grew up both in Shenzhen and also in London. Do you have lots of memories from your childhood? Yes, probably, but mainly about school. So school life and also family life, and that's all. Did you have many toys as a child? Yes, and I suppose I love like opposed to normal girls, I love guns and I love like fancing, so that's my toys during childhood. Not many doors. I'd like to move on to the topic of rivers and lakes. Do you have any rivers or lakes where you live? Yes, like even in Melbourne, like we have the Yarra River, which is so beautiful and I just love to have a walk after dinner, is there a river or like you enjoy visiting? Yes, I love Yarra River. And also we have another lake called Albert Park Lake. Now let's think about the topic of time. Are you normally late? No I'm a well organized person, I suppose I'm always on time and even ahead of time. Do you have any friends who are always late? Yes of course there are girls who always late for any plans like if you like last week, me and Wendy, we plan to go shopping, but then like he like she run 30 minutes late and that was, over. Do you tend to go to bed late or early? I try to go to bed early, but like in fact I'm going to bed pretty late and especially holidays you just don't have any plans for tomorrow so you can sleep until noon, so no pressure and then just figure out, oh, suddenly you find yourself 2 PM or 2 AM in morning. Make for one to two minutes. You will have one minute to think about what you want to say and I will give you a pencil and some paper to make notes if you want. Is that clear? Yeah, here is your paper and pencil. Thank you. You have one minute to prepare. Thank you. Now I'd like you to talk about a language you have studied. Remember, you have one to two minutes for this, so don't worry if I stop you. I'll tell you when the time is up Can you start speaking now, please? Sure, I took a French class in the University of Melbourne since last semester, and so I'm learning French now. We have 2 hours tutorial per week, but we have two tutorials. So each week you spend like four hours in class, but you need probably another four hours to prepare and to review your study. And French is so difficult, especially where you're not familiar with the most of European language, like German or anything like that. And especially for its chances like not like not similar with English. Like it has about, more than 10 tenses. So it's really difficult to know how the variations of the verb and also the structure of the sentence is different with English, especially when you have English in your mind, like to do the translation is the biggest mistake to do French. And also like pronunciation so difficult as well. But I mean, I know therefore every language, like if you're a not native speaker pronunciation, it's a very big problem, but French, Italian is especially difficult is because they have some little sound with it. I don't know tongue and you probably need to roll a tongue to do that, And it's so hard to do the R sound. Also, I start this course one year ago, so I've already led a year and I could basically have conversations with people, but not really diff difficult in depth like conversations. And I decide to learn this language because, when I used to grow up in England, I have a lot of French friends like who study like, in England. And they often do some small talks in French and really wanna understand what you're talking about. So that triggers me to know, yeah, I wanna learn this language and also, I wanna become a lawyer. Thank you. I won't stay on the topic of languages. Do you think countries should preserve their original language? Yes, of course they should preserve their original language, but they also need to accept new language just as well, Because we are living in a multicultural world, you can't just preserve one language, but without accepting new languages, and especially for some small countries like, like people are nowadays just getting so used to use English as academic language or otherwise, but you really need to keep your home language like as much as possible. I would say that ya. Yes, of course. I mean, just took example of English. Like if we're using English as a mostly academic language, then we can share essays, we can share research, results and which will improve communications across the world and also, reduce some kind of barriers and culture shocks. And because you could explain your ideas and mindsets to other people other than people in your country, why do some people start learning languages but quit so quickly, quick, so quickly? Probably, they want to like travel to somewhere and then in the language and before you travel to a place shows some kind of respect, like, especially like, when you go to a new country, like you really need to know how to say hello, how to say thank you, how to say sorry. And that's a like, that's being respectable. Thank you. That is the end of the speaking test. Thank you. "

We've got rommy from Australia who is going to be answering questions just like the real test and in previous videos when we've had native speakers, some people have asked, well, why do you have a native speaker? There are a couple of reasons, actually. The first reason is that sometimes native speakers do have to take the test because maybe they studied abroad in a country where English isn't the first language, and when they return to their country, maybe they are doctors or dentists, they have to take the aisle test. So that's one reason. The second reason that we use a native speakers is because we want to teach you lots of great features of language, whether that's grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation. You can learn many things and you can learn ideas from native speakers, so let without further ado, let's have a look at rommy from Australia, let's go. Okay, I hope you're ready. I'm just getting prepared. And rommy is a university student and she's interested in rowing. We're gonna hear about her hobbies and a little bit about her daily routine.

Did you notice at the end, and this is a very common feature of people who are young today, they often finished a sentence by saying, so, yeah, and that is kind of a natural conclusion of a sentence and these types of, phrases are often changing over time. And so you might find that people who say, so yeah, now maybe in 20 years won't say that, but it is a good feature of native and natural language.

So this would be an example of an idiomatic phrase, it's less common and this would be at the band 8 or 9 level in the, vocabulary, the lexical resource, really great feature of idiomatic language.

Remember, you have one to two minutes for this, so don't worry if I stop you. I'll tell you when the time is up, she'll start speaking now. I used to get pretty disappointed in my sisters. Every time I would come home and they would have trashed my room or taken stuff out of the drawers or still stolen my clothes. It used to be a very top, a very, touchy subject in my household because clothes would always go missing and I would always be very disappointed and angry and wondering where my favorite clothes were. And I think that coming to college, has made me realize how much I value them as sisters and how much I really don't, don't mind that they steal my clothes anymore or that they say things that sometimes let me down. I think that family has become such an important value to me. And I have realized that because I have moved away from home now, and I now find myself missing them a lot. And so in reality I've realized it's very much not a big deal at all. This doesn't seem to happen as much now. I think it's a massive issue of communication. And now I really trust my sisters and don't mind if they ask me to borrow something thing. So, yeah, I think my mom tried to get tries to get involved as well, which makes it even mo more of a bigger deal. But really when I look back on it, I can, I can see that it's not a big thing at all. And I really, and just, it's just made me realize how much, people tend to fight over such small things and get disappointed in people for things that they really didn't have a negative, that they really didn't do intentionally to hurt you or to put you down or make you feel bad.

If, if you talk about a touchy subject, it's a subject that maybe makes you emotional or makes you angry. Good word. Then she said, the pronunciation she talked about, and making me angry and she changed the inflection and the intonation at the end. Go back and listen to how she puts emphasis on that. And that's a natural feature of pronunciation. She's used the language, trashed my room. So she talked about her sisters coming home and trashing her room, which means to make a mess or to take things out of the drawers and create a problem in the room. And then she realized that she didn't reach the time limit, so she talked about what happened in the past. And then she said, well, that doesn't happen anymore.

So how we can give constructive feedback and help our students to learn, to learn from their mistakes. And I think it's really important when giving constructive feedback to say something positive first, to make sure you're not too negative and that you don't have a negative tone to your voice, that you're happy and that you're just generally trying to help them. You want to give off the vibe that you're just trying to help them and not that you're trying to put them down. I think it's one of the worst things when someone's telling you something and you know, they're just trying to let you down and trying to make you feel bad about yourself.

Maybe it feels like you're not going to get to rommy's level. Well, the important thing to remember is that if you really want to get to rommy's level, you can.

She explained she gave reasons, she didn't stop speaking, she didn't have any hesitation looking for language, It was all extremely natural. And this word natural is very important for lexical resource. Again, she had a wide range of vocabulary. She used words like trashing my room or it's not set in stone, you don't have to use lots of them throughout your speech, but you do have to demonstrate that you understand and how to use idiomatic phrases and less common phrases, phrasal verbs, all of those and high level words. Good job band 9, grammatical range and accuracy. I didn't hear any problems with accuracy. She made, a good use of a wide range of different types of com complex structures, so that we'll talk about the range of language, if sentences when sentences that sentences which sentences all of these subordination sentences. Good job band 9 and pronunciation rommy was effortless. She was easy to understand, she had good chunking, she had good inflection and intonation, so many things you can learn from rommy here, a band 9, I hope you took away lots of things from rommy's speech here.

                "output": "bye for now. Hello and welcome to this practice exam conducted by IELTS Daily. My name is Maddie and I'm your practice ILT speaking examiner. The questions in this test are designed to simulate the Ails speaking test, so let's start What's your first name please rommy let's talk about you Do you have a wide circle of friends or just a few close friends? I tend to have a wide range of friends. I don't have many friends that I would consider very close to me. I like to have a lot of people I can reach out to and a lot of different types of friends that I can go to for different reasons. So, yeah. And how often do you see your friends? It depends, I try to see them as much as possible. It can be very hard to arrange meetings with friends, especially when you have like a such a wide range. I see friends that I do sport with every day, almost because I play sport every day, but then other people I don't see as often, but I'm still just as close with when I meet up with them finally. And do you have a best friend? I would, I wouldn't really say that I have a best friend. I have a couple of friends I would consider myself to be closer with, but I think I think the word best friend can be very set in stone and, you know, no, things change life is pretty variable. So, I tend to just know who my close friends are. And yeah, I keep it at that. Now I'd like to move on to the topic of evening, what do you normally do in the evenings? If it's a normal day I'll be exhausted I'm always pretty tired, so I tend to just relax, have dinner with my family. And then I'll try and read a book if I have time or if it's during university, I usually have to do quite a little bit of study. If it's during the holidays or sometime where I have more time and I'm not as tired, I tend to want to catch up with friends, so I'll go out to dinner in the city or I might watch a movie with friends or go out for food and drinks. It really depends. And would you like to do an evening course in a subject? I'm not sure, I've never really considered it. I think, I don't think I would because evenings are a very precious time to me, it's a time I like to use to do stuff for myself and to relax. So I don't think I would try and fill my evenings with anything else. Now let's think about the topic of money. Are you good at saving money? No I'm not good at saving money at all I tend to identify a lot of shopping, so I really like finding new brands and new boutiques and I also love to go out and socialize with my friends. So I find it very hard to save money and that's something I'm definitely trying to work on. And have you ever made an expensive purchase? Yes, I have. I'd say I do a lot of rowing and that is a very expensive sport. So I'd say that all my expenses for that sport have been very, large, I would say. And the memberships are always pretty expensive. So I consider it something that is very important to me and it's obviously like one of my main sports that I do. So I tend to put it at a high priority. And what would you do if someone gave you a large amount of money? A, it's a very good question. I'm really not sure there's nothing that I really would need to spend on right now. I'd like to think that I would donate some of it as everyone, everybody would. I think, it would really help for my savings account, go towards saving up for a house in the future or just towards general day to day life. Pot 2 In the next part of the test I'm gonna give you a topic and I'd like you to speak for one to 2 minutes. You'll have one minute to think about what you wanna say, and I'll give you a pen and some paper to make notes if you want. Exactly, yes, here is your paper and here is your Kents. Do you have one minute to prepare? Thank you. Now I'd like you to talk about a time when you were disappointed by someone or something. Remember, you have one to two minutes for this, so don't worry if I stop you. I'll tell you when the time is up, she'll start speaking now. I used to get pretty disappointed in my sisters every time I would come home and they would have trashed my room or taken stuff out of the drawers or still stolen my clothes. It used to be a very top, a very, touchy subject in my household because clothes would always go missing and I would always be very disappointed and angry and wondering where my favorite clothes were. And I think that coming to college has mainly realize how much I value them as sisters and how much I really don't, don't mind that they steal my clothes anymore, or that they say things that sometimes let me down. I think that family has become such an important value to me. And I have realized that because I have moved away from home now, and I now find myself missing them a lot. And so in reality I've realized it's very much not a big deal at all. This doesn't seem to happen as much now. I think it's a massive issue of communication. And now I really trust my sisters and don't mind if they ask me to borrow something. So, yeah, I think my mom tried to get tries to get involved as well, which makes it even more of a bigger deal. But really when I look back on it, I can, I can see that it's not a big thing at all. And I really, and just, it's just made me realize how much people tend to fight over such small things and get disappointed in people for things that they really didn't have a negative, that they really didn't do intentionally to hurt you or to put you down or make you feel bad. So I think that's a really important thing to realize. Thank you. I want to stay on the topic of feelings. Is it important for people to share their honest opinion about things? At times, yes. I think honesty is one of the most important virtues. I think that, being honest with someone helps you build that trust and that communication. And I think that I always feel closer to someone when they've shared or they've spoken honestly to me, but I also do think at times it can be better to tell a little white lie, especially in the case where it's going to hurt someone else's feelings or where it's really not necessary for them to know, and, or just ricochet and have other effects and just impact everyone around. Is there a good way to give constructive feedback to someone about something? Yes, I definitely think there is. And this is something that I've learned about in one of the courses I'm studying at uni too, which was about, sports coaching. So how we can give constructive feedback and help our students to learn, to learn from their mistakes. And I think it's really important when giving constructive feedback to say something positive first, to make sure you're not too negative and that you don't have a negative tone to your voice, that you're happy and that you're just genuinely trying to help them. You want to give off the vibe that you're just trying to help them and not that you're trying to put them down. I think it's one of the worst things when someone's telling you something and you know, they're just trying to let you down and trying to make you feel bad about yourself. So I always try and start with something positive and then say, how about we try this? Or how about next time you do this? I think always phrasing as a question is also a more sensitive way to approach the topic and what can people learn from feelings of disappointment? A lot, I think in terms of my sport. I've been disappointed in results a lot of the time. I think disappointment can act as motivation very easily. It can be turned and manipulated into many things. But I think if you always try and manipulate it a positive way, and try and use it to your advantage, try and use it to motivate or to change something that you would have liked, you wouldn't have liked, to be said about yourself. I think it can always be used in a good way. Thank you. That is the end of this practice. I ought speaking test. Thank you. "

Are you ready to hear from, a native speaker today we've got rommy from Australia. There are a couple of reasons, actually. The first reason is that sometimes native speakers do have to take the test because maybe they studied abroad in a country where English isn't the first language. And when they return to their country, maybe they are doctors or dentists. They have to take the aisle test. So that's one reason. The second reason that we use a native speakers is because we want to teach you lots of great features of language, whether that's grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation. You can learn many things and you can learn ideas from native speakers. So let without further ado, let's have a look at rommy from Australia. Let's go. Okay, I hope you're ready. I'm just getting prepared. And rommy is a university student and she's interested in rowing. We're gonna hear about her hobbies and a little bit about her daily routine.

Did you notice at the end, and this is a very common feature of people who are young today, they often finished a sentence by saying, so, yeah, and that is kind of a natural conclusion of a sentence and these types of, phrases are often changing over time. And so you might find that people who say, so yeah, now maybe in 20 years won't say that, but it is a good feature of native and natural language.

The range of vocabulary, the range of grammatical structures. And I know that for many of you who are trying to reach the band 7, maybe this feels like it's unachievable. Maybe it feels like you're not going to get to rommy's level. Well, the important thing to remember is that if you really want to get to rommy's level, you can. It takes a bit of hard work, but for most of you, you're not actually trying to reach rommy's level. But what you can do is take away many of the things that she does really well in her test and try to apply them to yours and learn that the features of language that rommy is using. So what would I give rommy's score? Well, it probably won't surprise you that for all four sections, rommy is going to score 9. And we'll talk about them each individually fluencing coherence. She explained she gave reasons, she didn't stop speaking, she didn't have any hesitation looking for language, It was all extremely natural. And this word natural is very important for lexical resource. Again, she had a wide range of vocabulary. She used words like trashing my room or it's not set in stone, you don't have to use lots of them throughout your speech, but you do have to demonstrate that you understand and how to use idiomatic phrases and less common phrases, phrasal verbs, all of those and high level words. Good job band 9, grammatical range and accuracy. I didn't hear any problems with accuracy. She made, a good use of a wide range of different types of com complex structures, so that we'll talk about the range of language, if sentences when sentences that sentences which sentences all of these subordination sentences. Good job band 9 and pronunciation rommy was effortless. She was easy to understand, she had good chunking, she had good inflection and intonation, so many things you can learn from rommy here, a band 9, I hope you took away lots of things from rommy's speech here. I think she did a wonderful job and this video serves as an example of learning ideas, learning what other people do and how they do it is a great way for you to learn. I'm a teacher, so I can guide you.

The questions in this test are designed to simulate the Ails speaking test, so let's start What's your first name please rommy let's talk about you Do you have a wide circle of friends or just a few close friends? I tend to have a wide range of friends. I don't have many friends that I would consider very close to me. I like to have a lot of people I can reach out to and a lot of different types of friends that I can go to for different reasons. So, yeah. And how often do you see your friends? It depends, I try to see them as much as possible. It can be very hard to arrange meetings with friends, especially when you have like a such a wide range. I see friends that I do sport with every day, almost because I play sport every day, but then other people I don't see as often, but I'm still just as close with when I meet up with them finally. And do you have a best friend? I would, I wouldn't really say that I have a best friend. I have a couple of friends I would consider myself to be closer with, but I think I think the word best friend can be very set in stone and, you know, no, things change life is pretty variable. So, I tend to just know who my close friends are. And yeah, I keep it at that. Now I'd like to move on to the topic of evening, what do you normally do in the evenings? If it's a normal day I'll be exhausted I'm always pretty tired, so I tend to just relax, have dinner with my family. And then I'll try and read a book if I have time or if it's during university, I usually have to do quite a little bit of study. If it's during the holidays or sometime where I have more time and I'm not as tired, I tend to want to catch up with friends, so I'll go out to dinner in the city or I might watch a movie with friends or go out for food and drinks. It really depends. And would you like to do an evening course in a subject? I'm not sure, I've never really considered it. I think, I don't think I would because evenings are a very precious time to me, it's a time I like to use to do stuff for myself and to relax. So I don't think I would try and fill my evenings with anything else. Now let's think about the topic of money. Are you good at saving money? No I'm not good at saving money at all I tend to identify a lot of shopping, so I really like finding new brands and new boutiques and I also love to go out and socialize with my friends. So I find it very hard to save money and that's something I'm definitely trying to work on. And have you ever made an expensive purchase? Yes, I have. I'd say I do a lot of rowing and that is a very expensive sport. So I'd say that all my expenses for that sport have been very, large, I would say. And the memberships are always pretty expensive. So I consider it something that is very important to me and it's obviously like one of my main sports that I do. So I tend to put it at a high priority. And what would you do if someone gave you a large amount of money? A, it's a very good question. I'm really not sure there's nothing that I really would need to spend on right now. I'd like to think that I would donate some of it as everyone, everybody would. I think, it would really help for my savings account, go towards saving up for a house in the future or just towards general day to day life. Pot 2 In the next part of the test I'm gonna give you a topic and I'd like you to speak for one to 2 minutes. You'll have one minute to think about what you wanna say, and I'll give you a pen and some paper to make notes if you want. Exactly, yes, here is your paper and here is your Kents. Do you have one minute to prepare? Thank you. Now I'd like you to talk about a time when you were disappointed by someone or something. Remember, you have one to two minutes for this, so don't worry if I stop you. I'll tell you when the time is up, she'll start speaking now. I used to get pretty disappointed in my sisters every time I would come home and they would have trashed my room or taken stuff out of the drawers or still stolen my clothes. It used to be a very top, a very, touchy subject in my household because clothes would always go missing and I would always be very disappointed and angry and wondering where my favorite clothes were. And I think that coming to college has mainly realize how much I value them as sisters and how much I really don't, don't mind that they steal my clothes anymore, or that they say things that sometimes let me down. I think that family has become such an important value to me. And I have realized that because I have moved away from home now, and I now find myself missing them a lot. And so in reality I've realized it's very much not a big deal at all. This doesn't seem to happen as much now. I think it's a massive issue of communication. And now I really trust my sisters and don't mind if they ask me to borrow something. So, yeah, I think my mom tried to get tries to get involved as well, which makes it even more of a bigger deal. But really when I look back on it, I can, I can see that it's not a big thing at all. And I really, and just, it's just made me realize how much people tend to fight over such small things and get disappointed in people for things that they really didn't have a negative, that they really didn't do intentionally to hurt you or to put you down or make you feel bad. So I think that's a really important thing to realize. Thank you. I want to stay on the topic of feelings. Is it important for people to share their honest opinion about things? At times, yes. I think honesty is one of the most important virtues. I think that, being honest with someone helps you build that trust and that communication. And I think that I always feel closer to someone when they've shared or they've spoken honestly to me, but I also do think at times it can be better to tell a little white lie, especially in the case where it's going to hurt someone else's feelings or where it's really not necessary for them to know, and, or just ricochet and have other effects and just impact everyone around. Is there a good way to give constructive feedback to someone about something? Yes, I definitely think there is. And this is something that I've learned about in one of the courses I'm studying at uni too, which was about, sports coaching. So how we can give constructive feedback and help our students to learn, to learn from their mistakes. And I think it's really important when giving constructive feedback to say something positive first, to make sure you're not too negative and that you don't have a negative tone to your voice, that you're happy and that you're just genuinely trying to help them. You want to give off the vibe that you're just trying to help them and not that you're trying to put them down. I think it's one of the worst things when someone's telling you something and you know, they're just trying to let you down and trying to make you feel bad about yourself. So I always try and start with something positive and then say, how about we try this? Or how about next time you do this? I think always phrasing as a question is also a more sensitive way to approach the topic and what can people learn from feelings of disappointment? A lot, I think in terms of my sport. I've been disappointed in results a lot of the time. I think disappointment can act as motivation very easily. It can be turned and manipulated into many things. But I think if you always try and manipulate it a positive way, and try and use it to your advantage, try and use it to motivate or to change something that you would have liked, you wouldn't have liked, to be said about yourself. I think it can always be used in a good way. Thank you. That is the end of this practice. I ought speaking test. Thank you. "

So, like regardless of the weather in India, we have a lot of festivals. So, usually I do like to wear casual clothes, but like just a jeans and Asian, but like on occasions, on festive occasions, I wear like traditional Indian clothes and I get them specifically made because they like you can't, you can't really buy, like traditional Indian, Indian clothes in the malls. But I for personally, I do get the made tailor made for me and because then you can choose your own style. Your designs are a lot of like stuff like that. So yeah, when, when you go to a temple, I wear like, pure simple clothes because that is the tradition. So that, that makes me feel like really peaceful and calm because most of the time you wear like simple clothing when you go to a temple. So makes me feel calm when I wear those clothes and doing festivals, when I wear like those traditional Indian clothes, it makes me happy because it's, like a festival I've been celebrating since I was a kid. So during the Bali and holy and all, yes, in holy, I wear like everyone wears a white clothes because it's real colors on you. So if you get like, you go out with a white cloth and then when you come back, it's like all colorful. So different clothes for different occasions. As I was here, I have been wearing a lot of warm clothes and that makes me feel really warm. Yeah, and, I buy clothes from, from different, stores, I suppose, depending on what kind of clothes I want and, So, yeah. And, when I go for an interview, I most later as informals.

So when you're buying, like when you're wearing a specific label, the people recognize it and then it shows like what kind of class you belong to and it is a huge thing in India, I think. So I think it, it, it's because of that. It shows like you are from a different class of society and it shows your your affluence. I think you can flaunt your affluence that way. Maybe that. "

So in schools, we wear uniforms and we are trained that way. When we go to a temple, we have a certain set of clothes. When we have festivals, we have certain set of clothes. So I think when we are trained to dress in a certain way, in a certain setting, you get used to it. So I don't think it's a like people are forcing you to wear like formal clothes in an office setting, but oh, it's a tricky one. Well, I don't think someone should be forced, but as individuals, we should be, aware enough of what not to wear in our official setting. So we should make that decision by ourselves. When you don't feel like you're forced to do it. "

Like I think companies like Google have made it really ya popular to where, where like engineers there are like smallest of people. They just go to office wearing CLA casual clothes. It just in a teacher and jeans, which is very casual. And they lay more importance on on your work. I think like how how you work and how you, how much you contribute rather than what you wear. So that is really a refreshing change, I think. So it doesn't, it shouldn't matter what you wear, but like how you work and how much you contribute. So I think times are changing and people are really getting more relaxed about what you wear. "
            },
            {
                "input": "Okay, that's the end. I'm also test well then, so the speaking test has four criteria, so pronunciation is number one, then we have lexical resource, which is just another way of saying vocabulary. And then we have grammatical range and accuracy. So let's just call that grammar. And then we have fluency, incoherence. Okay, so let's start off with pronunciation. So I could understand 100 percent of what you were saying, which is very, very important. If the examiner couldn't understand 100 percent of what you were saying, then they probably would give you a at least a six or below for pronunciation. But I could understand 100 percent of what you were saying. You do have a tiny little bit of, we call accent interference. But that didn't stop me actually, understanding what you said at, at any time. It was very, very easy to understand what you were saying. Now we'd also think about higher level pronunciation features, things like in intonation, sentence stress, word stress, connected speech, and you're actually at a very high level in terms of, higher level pronunciation features. And so for pronunciation, I would give you a band 8 because I can understand 100 percent of what you're saying without any effort whatsoever. And you have a very, strong, use of those higher level, pronunciation features in terms of vocabulary and your accuracy is very, very good. You rarely, slip up in terms of the, your accuracy for vocabulary and your range is also very, very good. And you have some, topic specific words for nearly everything that I ask you for. You're not searching for vocabulary. You know, you can access the vocabulary very, very easily and use that very, very well. I think for you, if you were to do the IELTS test again, I would encourage you during your preparation to take some more chances with vocabulary and maybe show how broad your vocabulary actually is because I think your vocabulary is much, much broader than what you actually, showed there today. But we didn't give you any coaching or anything like that before. We did this, but next time you, I would, just try and during your preparation to take some more chances, but in the real test, you use the hundred percent rule, only use a vocabulary that you're 100 percent sure about. And grammar, you had a couple of very small slips, but the vast majority of your grammar was 100 percent accurate. Nearly all error free sentences, you used a wide range of structures, complex sentences, simple sentences, you had no problem with tenses. So I asked you about the past, the present, the future. Asked you how things have changed since, you know, how have they changed over the last few decades? You know, a problem with many of those tenses. So your grammar is probably your strongest point. I have no worries really with your grammar, you'd a couple of little small problems, but that is totally natural, even native speakers have little slips. So for your grammar, I would give you a bandaid as well. And for your vocabulary, I would also give you a band eight, but, that would be something that I would, if you did, you were to do the test today immediately, you m might get a 7 for vocabulary if you didn't show the rain, change your vocabulary that you're capable of. So if you were to do the test tomorrow, I would say, you know, just use some more advanced adjectives and nouns and show how good your vocabulary actually is. Your fluency is also very, very good. You don't have any, you don't speak with any noticeable effort. So you don't have to think about the grammar of the vocal popularly. If you're linguistically, you're very advanced. So you don't, you're, that doesn't affect your fluency. And you're able to speak without, without much effort at all. However, the one thing that, I would say is your, not your weakness, but this is something that many advanced students like you are not aware of is that, you need to develop your answers as much as you can. Espec, especially for part 3. So part 1, they're just normal everyday questions about yourself, but you were giving sometimes one word or just a few word answers. So I often had to say like, why is this? So I said, what are you studying? And you just said I'm studying, yes. And why do you like that? So if we were having a normal conversation, no problem, because that is, that's totally normal to set up. But remember, you're in a test and the examiner has to judge your pronunciation, your vocabulary, your ground summer, your fluency. So just one word answer is they don't, they don't have enough data to go on. Really. Espec, especially for part 3. So part 1, they're just normal everyday questions about yourself, but you were giving sometimes one word or just a few word answers. So I often had to say like, why is this? So I said, what are you studying? And you just said I'm studying, yes. And why do you like that? So if we were having a normal conversation, no problem, because that is, that's totally normal to set up. But remember, you're in a test and the examiner has to judge your pronunciation, your vocabulary, your ground summer, your fluency. So just one word answer is they don't, they don't have enough data to go on. Really. ",
                "output": "They teach us differently in India then. "
            },
            {
                "input": "they teach you differently. Yeah, what do they say? ",
                "output": "Because, I have a tendency to like, just go on until they stop me because that's what, I saw on YouTube video, but then they told me like, just answer the question, don't go off on a tangent. "
            },
            {
                "input": "Yeah, so, so, so I just, I think that's, that's a few different things. So one, when going off at a tangent, you shouldn't do that because that you're going to lower your score for coherence and because coherence is that did the answer make sense? So if I ask you about clothing and you start to talk about your favorite music that that's a problem. What your Indian teacher, was probably referring to might have been that, but it could also be that certain students just talk on and on and on and on as much as possible. And in part 1, the, I know this is frustrating advice, but not too short, not too long. So what does that mean? So too long, The problem with that is the examiner has to ask you a range of different questions. So they will keep stopping you. And often students will be like, oh, what did I do? Did I do something wrong? And they will get very flustered. So a good teacher should not tell you, just keep talking on and on and on and on, especially for a part, part 1. So a good way to answer part 1 questions is answer the question and then give a little bit more detail or an example or an explanation, just a little bit more information for the, for the examiner to judge your answer on and understand your answer fully for that question. So I don't like giving exact sentence number of sentences because then people are thinking about number of words and number of sentences. But, you know, for example, what do you, what do you study in university? I like to study data science or I like to study business because, and then explain why you like it or what would you like to do in the future? I would like to be a data scientist because I really, you know, you like this, you like that. Or I would love to work for Google because my brother works for Google or something like that. You know, a real example, part 2, you did very, very well in terms of coherence because you spoke for the full two minutes and you had a little slip at the end, but that's no big deal. The examiner is not judging you on one little slip. They're judging you on your whole performance and you did very, very well for part 2. Part 3 is the part where you really do need to develop your answers because there are part 1 is just questions about you, whereas part 3 are more abstract questions about ideas in general. So I didn't ask you, you know, what are your favorite clothes? I asked you, why do people buy designer clothes? Like a more abstract question. So that requires you to, to answer the question and then develop your answer, provide reasons for your answer, provide explanations, and then you could also develop by giving some examples. So one way you could immediately improve your coherence would be to throw in some examples in there. So, for example, let me have a look at the question that we asked you. Thank you got here somewhere, somewhere. So the last question was, I have work clothes changed in the last few decades and you talked about Google and that was really good. You could also maybe talked about, 20 years ago, what were software development companies or tech companies like, should people be forced to wear certain clothes? You maybe you could say, you know, someone working as a police officer, yes, or someone, you know, you're not being judged on the content, you're being judged on how you say it. You're, as I said, fluency, enunciation, grammar, vocabulary is not, the content is not important, but coherence is important. Developing the answer, especially for part 3. So if you, I think if I was to give you any advice, that would be the main thing to work on would be the coherence part 1, give a little bit more, more information and then part 3, fully explain it, give some examples and you can also, answer them by saying, well, some people would think, yes, people should wear, be forced to wear clothes and this is why they would think this. And here's an example of this, for example, police, whereas other people who work in the tech industry would say absolutely not, you can wear anything you want. But I think personally this, you know, so you're do, so you can really develop it by looking at things from different angles and, but the difficult things for most students are pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary. You don't have any real issues with those whatsoever. They take a very long time to improve, fluency can take a long time to improve. No problems there. Coherence, you can improve it in a day. So you would be, I think that you could do even better than the last time you did the test, which you got a band 8, I think with a little bit of practice, you can do even better. Alright, thank you. Do you have any questions? Well done. Alright, thank you. Do you have any questions? Well done. ",

Now watch and learn the first strategy to get a perfect band 9 in part 1 is to build confidence. It's okay to be nervous going into the exam, but you do want to be full of confidence as soon as you start speaking. In order to build your confidence, you should practice for the speaking interview months before your exam. Also, arrive to the exam center an hour before the start time of your speaking interview, take a couple of speaking scripts with you. Find other candidates waiting for their exam and ask them to practice with you. When you meet with the examiner, imagine that the examiner is like your grandfather or your grandmother. Visualize this. It's a person who loves you, cares for you, and does not judge you. You have to speak loud and clearly so grandpa and grandma can understand you. Use the icebreaker questions to build your confidence when the examiner asks you for your passport and for your name. Whether you work or study, remember to speak in full sentences, loud and clear. This will really build your confidence going into the part 1 questions. Again, make sure to practice this before your exam. Listen to how these Band 9 candidates use these icebreaker questions and give clear full sentence answers and what is your full name? My first name is Madina and my family name is say about, please call me Medina, okay? Medina, may I see your identification?

Make sure that when you answer part 1 questions, you use the pronouns.

                "input": "Hey, Chris here from IELTS Vantage and in this video, what we're gonna do is take a real student who got a band 8 inner speaking test and show you exactly what she did for part two of her speaking test. So what we've done is we've recreated the speaking test in our office. I've shown her the Q card, given her one minute to go through it, and then we listen to her answer. But more importantly, what I also did was give her some advice before she began her test telling her what to do for part 2 in order to help her through that. And then I give her feedback immediately after. So you're gonna be able to listen to my advice, listen to her performance, think about what she did, and then listen to my feedback and learn from it. Without further ado, here we go. So Rashmi, now let's move on to part 2 of the speaking test. So part 2 is known as the long term, where the examiner will give you a card and he or she will give you one minute to plan. So you can just make, you won't be writing full sentences, just a little bullet points or thinking about what you might want to talk about. And then they will begin the clock and you will speak for between one and two minutes and the examiner will stop you. You don't have to be thinking about time like, am I at 1 minute fiftyeight seconds or anything like that to focus totally on your speaking. Don't be thinking about the clock or time or anything like that. And the best way to, to do it is just keep talking. And the examiner, believe me, will stop you because here she does not want to. Let's be there all evening listening to you. So don't worry about about time. Just keep talking. The challenge for most students in part 2 is what happened to you the last time where you run out of things to say because we never really, when we're talking naturally to someone, we don't really think about time. And then the examiner gives you this and says, speak for up to two minutes and two minutes. It doesn't seem that long. But actually just speaking without interruption for two minutes is, is a little bit challenging. So, and the reason that students run out of time is so you'll be given this card and you'll have the question here. And then it said you should talk about and then .1, point 2.3, and .4. This is not the question, by the way, just in case people think that we're cheating. This is just says question. And what happens is people speak about point .1, then about .2, then about .3, then about .4. And by the time they get there, it's like fortyfive seconds or 50 seconds. And then, oh, what do I do? You know, what do I talk about? So what you should do is use these bullet points as just pointers to help you out. Don't rely on them. So, you know, you know what a crutch is when someone breaks a leg, don't rely on them as a crutch, use them just as a tool to help you. So the best way to the best students I've ever worked with don't need the bullet points at all. A lot of teachers teach people that you must talk about .1, then .2, then .3, then .4. That's nonsense. You don't have to do that, you don't have to mention any of the bullet points, You just, you have to talk about the question asked. As long as you're talking about the question, the bullet points don't matter. Again, use them as tools, not as a crutch. So the best students I've ever worked with, they just look at the question and they talk about it naturally, they don't look at the paper at all. Now that is not possible for many, many students. So what I teach students is have a look at the forward bulb, have a look at the question, think about the question, then look at the bullet points and think about which ones you want to talk about, which ones you would find easy to talk about. And you can just put a tick beside those ones or you could delete the ones that you don't want to talk about. And then you can add more bullet points that are related to that question. And you could talk about things like, how you feel about that thing. Maybe a story about the past, the future, you could talk about what you're going to do with that in the future or that, that topic. You could describe that there are many, many, many other things that you could talk about other than other than the bullet points there. So what happens is you talk naturally as, as best you can, and then when you run out of things to say you can just look down and, oh I'm gonna talk about that one and then talk a little bit more. So you, it's you have like bullets in your gun. You're not gonna run out of bullets, you know, does that make sense? Yeah, and in terms of, fluency and coherence, this is where the examiner can really test your fluency and your coherence, especially your fluency because only if you're a band, band 8, band 9, which I think you're capable of getting there. You can only speak for two minutes fluently if your language level is at a certain level, you might pause or hesitate to think of ideas, but you won't pause and hesitate to think of the grammar, the vocabulary. So there's a difference between linguistic pauses and idea pauses. So it's okay to pause and think about what you're gonna say for, you know, a second or, or whatever, you know, very short amount of time. But the examiner will not notice the difference between like linguistic pauses and just trying to think, but you shouldn't have to think about it that much if you use that strategy. I've just told you that strategy right now. Anybody watching it would be better for them to practice that quite a bit before the actual test, but I think you'll be fine. I think you'll be fine. Pronunciation, often students have a problem with, again, speaking inside their mouth or mumbling because they get tired throughout so they get past one minute and they start to run out of ideas and then they're tired of speaking and they kind of mumble. So try and enunciate as as much as you can. And grammar and vocabulary, I think you'll be fine as well. You might want to, when you see the topic, try and think of some topics, specific vocabulary that you might want to use or some idioms or phrasal verbs or things like that. You don't have to use idioms. You don't have to use phrasal verbs, but they do helped. It's, idiomatic language. Idiomatic language does not mean idioms. Idioms are a type of idiomatic language, phrasal verbs or a type of idiomatic language, slang, colloquialisms, local language until you'll hear around here, that's another, it's natural English. There's a difference between textbook English. It's like standard English and then English that you'll hear out on the street, two very different things. So the more you sign like a native English speaker that the higher your vocabulary score is going to be because you're using that idiomatic language, but it doesn't mean in just idioms because some students, they go into the test and like every sentence has four idioms in it. Hello I'm over the moon to the and once in a blue moon, I get to do this with, you know, that's not how normal people's speak. So try and avoid that. Any questions before we start part 2. Okay, so I'm gonna give you this, you can look at it, make notes, for one minute. When, when the one minute is up, I will start the clock and ask you to speak for one to two minutes and I'll stop you. Okay, that. Okay, rashby when you're ready. Okay, rashby when you're ready. ",
                "output": "oh, I don't think I have one too many expensive things. I think, I'm not materialistic at all, so I don't tend to spend too much, but if education counts, then I think the most expensive thing I've ever bought is an education at Queens. I paid ￡25000 to be here. That does not include the plane ticket, but yes, till till date, that would be the most expensive thing. I, where I bought it. Well, I live in India, so, I came here at Queens and I came here in the UK to study at Queens. Education has become really expensive, but I think this is by far the most expensive ever. But it was worth it because I don't a lot, they have really good infrastructure and the quality of the teaching stuff is really good. I met a students from all over the world here, so the cultural exchange was really good. I learned a lot, not just from being in the classroom, but from outside of the classroom as well and just talking to people on the streets or volunteering. It gave me a lot of experience, which I don't think I could have gotten just being in a classroom. So I did pay for education here to study marketing and Ana analytics, but I came out learning a lot more than just that. Why I bought it because, I really wanted to study analytics, like I mentioned before, but, besides that, a Queens is a really good brand and it has a really good image in India and I think all over the world, it's in the Russells group. So, an education at Queens is going, I knew that if I invested in it, it was going to pay off. "

So the question says, the most expensive thing and you talked about education, so that would be fine, but if it said the most expensive item that would, that would not, that would be, you know, like a phone or a car or something like that.

                "input": "Yeah, that's, I mean, if you have a choice between answering the question clearly, which you did, or trying to think of nice words as you said, or big words, it's far, far better to naturally answer the question because that's the most important thing.

You could have improved your range a little bit and we'll talk about that in a second, but you should never go into the speaking test thinking i'm going to use lots of big words because that messes up so many people.

So, you know, there's a try and try and, next time you could work on your collocations a little bit on, on, your range of, of especially descriptive adjectives. A good way to think about it is instead of saying really something, you know, there's the, instead of saying really good, amazing, or, or it's like this, this mainline meeting is really nice. It's delicious though. That lady over there is really good looking, beautiful. So there's often one higher level adjective to use instead of really plus a simpler adjective. So that's, that would be a way that you could, improve your vocabulary a little bit, but also remember you're being judged on, the, your whole performance. You're not being judged on what many students are probably writing in the comments right now is she said good three times. Like that is not how the examiner is judging you. The examiner is not is judging your whole use of vocabulary, not that you use the word good three times in one or two sentences. The examiner would listen to the rest of your vocabulary and it's not like negative marking. But just I think you, as I said before, I think that your vocabulary is far wider ranging than you are showing in the test. Because when I look at your writing, your, your, your vocabulary is much more wide ranging. It's always accurate. So I think you can take AAA chat, and I also think it's some higher level users of English. Are you used to just saying really good? And the teachers are good because that's how normal people speak most of the time. But because we're in a test and we want to get as high a mark as possible, you would want to take, some chances. The only time I would change that advice would be if you were slightly lower level and you were, say, at a 6.5 and you needed a 7. I wouldn't tell someone at that level to take more chances with vocabulary because that would probably lower their score because they would make so many mistakes. But because your accuracy is so high, I think that you could vary it a little bit more. And your grammar was excellent. I've probably already mentioned that, pronunciation was good. There were some words like you're saying, materialistic, and you said it very, very quickly and kind of under inside your mouth. So that's what, so it might have been, I understood exactly what you meant, but, someone on the, watching on the video might have been like, I didn't quite understand that. So trying to enunciate as much as you can and, but you don't have a problem with, with, with your pronunciation at all. So just a little, again, a little tune tuning rather than a criticism.

I started my career, you know, in Stem and then ventured through 16 different industries cause I didn't really know where in the world of work I fitted in to, but eventually I realized that all this became really useful for me to gain all the skills that I needed, you know, in communication and brought it all together in a field that I was deeply passionate about that allowed me to channel what I really love about my work and a topic that I love, you know, to make a difference in people's lives. Being a speaker is the perfect place to do this because you could influence people's thoughts and inspire positivity in people's lives, which is something that you could do in other places. But the impact is so much more immediate and you are affecting people in such a big way and affecting a bigger audience as well whilst you're doing doing it. And this is something that I'm very lucky to be able to do now, and I don't take it for granted and know that the journey for me to get here has been really long.

It's threatening a lot of jobs like writing and recruiting and con connecting, you know, with with people.

So a very big proportion of it, you know, needs to feel fulfilled. And it can only be fulfilled if you're, you understand, you know what, what you like authentically inside, you know, and then, you know, go into a career.

                "input": "That is the end of part 1. We will now continue with part 2, clearly tumby deserves a band 9 perfect score for her performance on part 1. Right away, she answers confidently with full sentences using good vocabulary and professional language. It is obvious for the examiner that tonvi has prepared for her IELTS. Exam practice and preparation are key To get those high band scores, you must practice different ways of responding to the question, May I see your identification and what is your full name? You can do this on our channel in live classes, Thursdays to Saturdays by connecting with teachers and students practicing your speaking. Make sure to subscribe and get notifications of our live classes so you too can practice the introduction and questions for the IELTS. Exam tonby improves her band score by using correlative conjunctions early on when asked about work and study, she says I both work and study, and then explains that she works at a restaurant to support her college studies. Correlative conjunctions emphasize language and show a kind of connective that a lot of lower level students tend to avoid using these paired conjunctions like both and not only, but also either or whether or neither, nor help you to increase your band scores. Practice these at home and in our live classes, tunby gets a high band score because she uses some idioms accurately and naturally. You should never force an idiom or use an idiom where you are not 100 percent sure that it is correct. Notice when tummy says that she uses her computer to unwind a bit a lot of students make the mistake of saying, unwind myself. This is inaccurate and strange English. It literally means that you're all twisted up and you're unwinding yourself instead of the idiom to unwind, which means to relax. We never add a pronoun after unwind. Be careful, only use idioms when you are sure that it is correct. Now let's continue for this part, I will show you some questions. You will have one minute to look at the questions, think about the answers. You have some note paper and that pencil there in front of you can use that to take notes in the one minute time if you wish, and then you will have one to two minutes to speak. I will tell you when to start and when to stop. Please do not touch the question paper. Describe a good law in your country. Your one minute preparation time begins now. Time time to your one minute preparation. Time is up. Please begin speaking. Time time to your one minute preparation. Time is up. Please begin speaking. ",
                "output": "After some consideration, I have chosen to talk about the legal drinking age in India. I mean the age at which people are allowed to consume alcohol. In most parts of the country, people must be at least twentyone years old to legally consume alcoholic beverages such as wine, beer and spirits. And I think this is a very good law for several reasons. While it is through that Indians can vote and even get married at a younger age, drinking alcohol responsibly does require a lot of maturity. There are a few places which allow people to drink alcohol at a young age like Goa, but these places are designed and monitored for entertainment. So it's a bit different than most of the country as most people know that alcohol can lead to a lot of bad decisions and problems, as well as some problems caused by irresponsible drinking like car accidents, violence, and social disturbance, such as loud parties, like many other people in India, I have known about this rule from a young age since my early teens as I have observed people older than me drinking at social events and seeing alcohol in movies and in the media. I think this law affects pretty much everyone in the country, as it helps to maintain a social order and minimizes crime and injury. I know that in some countries, the legal drinking age is like 18 or 19, which also leads to a lot of problems. 18 year olds have less commitments and then the process of leaving home or going to post secondary school, but twentyone year olds have more commitments and have seen the, adult world. So not having this law would lead to a lot of for authorities and the general public. "

She answers the question right away saying that a good law in India is having the legal drinking age being twentyone years of age. Then she explains her reasoning and once she's finisheded, she uses a concluding sentence. She states that not having this law would create a lot of headaches for the authorities. This indicates to the examiner that she is done and ready for part 3, Again, having this level of confidence and structure requires practice. You can practice this in our weekly live classes on our YouTube channel where we accept student volunteers for various Q card like questions, make sure to subscribe and join and volunteer.

                "input": "That is the end of part 1. We will now continue with part 2, clearly tumby deserves a band 9 perfect score for her performance on part 1. Right away, she answers confidently with full sentences using good vocabulary and professional language. It is obvious for the examiner that tonvi has prepared for her IELTS. Exam practice and preparation are key To get those high band scores, you must practice different ways of responding to the question, May I see your identification and what is your full name? You can do this on our channel in live classes, Thursdays to Saturdays by connecting with teachers and students practicing your speaking. Make sure to subscribe and get notifications of our live classes so you too can practice the introduction and questions for the IELTS. Exam tonby improves her band score by using correlative conjunctions early on when asked about work and study, she says I both work and study, and then explains that she works at a restaurant to support her college studies. Correlative conjunctions emphasize language and show a kind of connective that a lot of lower level students tend to avoid using these paired conjunctions like both and not only, but also either or whether or neither, nor help you to increase your band scores. Practice these at home and in our live classes, tunby gets a high band score because she uses some idioms accurately and naturally. You should never force an idiom or use an idiom where you are not 100 percent sure that it is correct. Notice when tummy says that she uses her computer to unwind a bit a lot of students make the mistake of saying, unwind myself. This is inaccurate and strange English. It literally means that you're all twisted up and you're unwinding yourself instead of the idiom to unwind, which means to relax. We never add a pronoun after unwind. Be careful, only use idioms when you are sure that it is correct. Now let's continue for this part, I will show you some questions. You will have one minute to look at the questions, think about the answers. You have some note paper and that pencil there in front of you can use that to take notes in the one minute time if you wish, and then you will have one to two minutes to speak. I will tell you when to start and when to stop. Please do not touch the question paper. Describe a good law in your country. Your one minute preparation time begins now. Time time to your one minute preparation. Time is up. Please begin speaking. Time time to your one minute preparation. Time is up. Please begin speaking. ",
                "output": "After some consideration, I have chosen to talk about the legal drinking age in India. I mean the age at which people are allowed to consume alcohol. In most parts of the country, people must be at least twentyone years old to legally consume alcoholic beverages such as wine, beer and spirits. And I think this is a very good law for several reasons. While it is through that Indians can vote and even get married at a younger age, drinking alcohol responsibly does require a lot of maturity. There are a few places which allow people to drink alcohol at a young age like Goa, but these places are designed and monitored for entertainment. So it's a bit different than most of the country as most people know that alcohol can lead to a lot of bad decisions and problems, as well as some problems caused by irresponsible drinking like car accidents, violence, and social disturbance, such as loud parties, like many other people in India, I have known about this rule from a young age since my early teens as I have observed people older than me drinking at social events and seeing alcohol in movies and in the media. I think this law affects pretty much everyone in the country, as it helps to maintain a social order and minimizes crime and injury. I know that in some countries, the legal drinking age is like 18 or 19, which also leads to a lot of problems. 18 year olds have less commitments and then the process of leaving home or going to post secondary school, but twentyone year olds have more commitments and have seen the, adult world. So not having this law would lead to a lot of for authorities and the general public. "

She answers the question right away saying that a good law in India is having the legal drinking age being twentyone years of age. Then she explains her reasoning and once she's finisheded, she uses a concluding sentence. She states that not having this law would create a lot of headaches for the authorities. This indicates to the examiner that she is done and ready for part 3, Again, having this level of confidence and structure requires practice.

                "input": "That is the end of part 1. Now that you have seen part one of the interview, it is clear that tarana is an expert user of the English language. She is fluent. She does not hesitate to express her ideas clearly and with accurate grammar. Her pronunciation is easy to understand. Now here's a tip for you to make sure that you get a high band score. Notice how tarana does not use the word you in part 1? This is a common mistake amongst IELTS candidates. Often IELTS candidates will use the word you when they are answering questions in Part 1, however, part 1 is not about the examiner, it's about you, the candidate. So instead of saying you, it's important to use the pronouns I, me and my, it's common to make this mistake as we naturally replace this pronoun with the pronoun you to get the listeners attention. But this makes for low level communication. So when you're practicing for part one of the IELTS exam, any time you catch yourself saying you stop and correct the sentence, replace the word with I, me, my and say it again, keep this in mind and it can easily save you a half band score on your next IELTS speaking test. Like when the examiner asks, where can you buy drinking water in your area, tarana immediately answers that in my area, there are a multitude of places where I can buy clean drinking water. Water she doesn't say in my area. There are lots of places where you can buy drinking water. Of course, this would be incorrect because the examiner does not live in your area, So make sure that you're always using, I mean my and not you. We will now continue with part 2. For part 2, I will show you some questions. You will have one minute to read these questions and prepare your answers. You have a pencil there and some note paper.

It is relatively a new building that was established and constructed at the end of the 20th century. So it is a couple of decades old.

Of course, there are lots of modern equipments throughout the building. It is wired with fiber optics for lightning fast internet and there are several computer rooms, both with Apple and PC for students and teachers to use.

It's important in part 2, in the one minute preparation time to think of at least two or three different possible choices and pick the best 1. Don't necessarily pick the first idea that comes to mind. Then you will notice that tarana structures her response very what? Well, talking about a place, she describes its appearance, what the university looks like, then she talks about the people who attend the university as well as the activities that happen at the university and her experiences. It's this structure of appearance, location, location, activities, attendees, and experience that give a well rounded one to two minute story when talking about a place.

All of the information she shares is clear and comprehensible for the examiner, she does not pause or slow down to think about grammar or vocabulary, she shows band 9 level lexical reason using a broad range of language features, including idiomatic language and lots of paraphrasing in addition, her grammatical range and accuracy includes complex and compound sentences. Her pronunciation is about a band 8 overall, though she maintains a band 9 in part 1. Take a look at these examples when the examiner asks her about her hobbies at the very beginning, she immediately pays attention to answer with a full complex sentence, she says there are several hobbies that I like doing while hanging out with my friends, and then she even goes one step further to include the example. Last weekend I played a game of Monopoly with a couple of my friends. This is a complete answer, it has an answer, an explanation, and an example she uses a subordinating conjunction while to connect her phrases and ideas for improved fluency. It's exactly this caliber of language that earns the band 9 score. Later on, when the examiner asks her the preference of boats versus planes, she answers very clearly and decisively. She says that she likes boats rather than planes because they are way less crowded and more comfortable, again, including the example of going on a boating trip with her uncle. It is this type of decisive language and affirmative language that is needed for clear communication. Oftentimes, students will answer by saying, well, I like both, or it depends. This is not a good strategy for the IELTS. It's better to just choose one side, be decisive, give a good explanation, and then move on to the next question. Also notice how Amba uses the pronoun. I like boats more than planes. And in the previous example, she says I have several hobbies. She doesn't use the pronouns you or people. She realizes that questions in part 1 are about her, so she directs the answers from her own subjective point of view. Using I, me, my, this again adds to her level of clarity and coherence for that expert level of English usage. Now let's take a look at part 2. That is the end of part 1. Now we will continue with, part 2. For part 2, I will show you some questions.

All of the information she shares is clear and comprehensible for the examiner, she does not pause or slow down to think about grammar or vocabulary, she shows band 9 level lexical reason using a broad range of language features, including idiomatic language and lots of paraphrasing in addition, her grammatical range and accuracy includes complex and compound sentences. Her pronunciation is about a band 8 overall, though she maintains a band 9 in part 1. Take a look at these examples when the examiner asks her about her hobbies at the very beginning, she immediately pays attention to answer with a full complex sentence, she says there are several hobbies that I like doing while hanging out with my friends, and then she even goes one step further to include the example. Last weekend I played a game of Monopoly with a couple of my friends. This is a complete answer, it has an answer, an explanation, and an example she uses a subordinating conjunction while to connect her phrases and ideas for improved fluency. It's exactly this caliber of language that earns the band 9 score. Later on, when the examiner asks her the preference of boats versus planes, she answers very clearly and decisively. She says that she likes boats rather than planes because they are way less crowded and more comfortable, again, including the example of going on a boating trip with her uncle. It is this type of decisive language and affirmative language that is needed for clear communication. Oftentimes, students will answer by saying, well, I like both, or it depends. This is not a good strategy for the IELTS. It's better to just choose one side, be decisive, give a good explanation, and then move on to the next question. Also notice how Amba uses the pronoun. I like boats more than planes. And in the previous example, she says I have several hobbies. She doesn't use the pronouns you or people. She realizes that questions in part 1 are about her, so she directs the answers from her own subjective point of view. Using I, me, my, this again adds to her level of clarity and coherence for that expert level of English usage. Now let's take a look at part 2. That is the end of part 1. Now we will continue with, part 2. For part 2, I will show you some questions. You will have one minute to read these questions, think about your answers, you have no paper in your pen there in front of you can take notes in the one minute and if you wish you will then you will have two minutes to speak.

We've got the solution for you in academy, send us your writing, we'll check them out thoroughly in less than 30. Okay, Evan, now let's see what you did. So we can get started with the first criteria. I give you the details, of what you're expected to do based on that and what you did, your own performance. And then you can talk about your overall band score. Okay, so, to talk about your fluency and coherence, I can say that it was a very good performance because you were quite fluent when you were talking to me. And the very good thing is that you were speaking very naturally. You were not trying to memorize, I mean, use, memorize language or remember the things that you planned to say or to talk about in different topics. It was all very natural. And other than that, you had some hesitations, but very natural hesitations because you can pause, when you don't remember the language, the vocabulary, the grammar, and that, that is not a good thing in your fluency and coherence, but your pauses were all, content related. Like you were pausing because you were thinking of the next idea. And of course, you didn't have many pauses. It was just, you know, a few pauses, natural ones. Besides, I can talk about your topic developments In part 1, you were to give me some short answers in part 2 to cover your tuminus and to talk about all the bullet points and in part 3, some longer answers and you did So you how you explained and how you covered your ideas. You said something, then you gave me more explanations and examples to just support what you had said. So it was a really good one here and the last thing regarding your fluency and coherence is how you used, different discourse markers and connectives. And it was all used in the correct place in the correct sentence. So being error free is something that really matters. And I also speaking that, of course, you were error free and some discourse marker, so to say, actually and other words. Well, so yes, it was really good. I really liked your affluencia and coherence, talking about the, you know, based on the band descriptors and now talk about the next criteria, your lyxical resource, your vocabulary in your lyxical resource, you know, some things matter. The first one is how you use a range of words, vocabulary. Didn't give me the answer very directly and straight away. It was, in a way that you just bought yourself some time to just think of what you want to say. And then you gave me the answer and that's okay. And, your paraphrasing was also good. I would say 1, 1 little thing that you can work on is how you paraphrase the examiner's question, because you shouldn't repeat the exact same question and at times you were doing it. So I mean, the synonyms you used are vocabulary to name some, to mention some. For example, my sibling instead of my sisters or brothers, or the following day, instead of the next day, make a reservation to walk past something to be impressed. Or, when people are dedicated, I mean, dedicate their time to something. So it was all really good how you were using the words, but how you were paraphrasing your own words or sentences that you could paraphrase my questions as well, not to repeat the same words. That's the only thing I can talk about here in this criteria. And now you're grammatical range and accuracy. What was really, I mean, what I can really mention, regarding your grammatical range and accuracies that first of all, you were error free, just like how you were using the connectives and structures because it is really important to use the appropriate structures and the sentences and you were using a range of different tenses. I used to, or those past tenses present future other than the conditional sentences, relative cause and also compound sentences, subordinate causes. So different, different, complex structures that you are using very naturally and flexibly And of course, the connectives you used that I mentioned in the affluency and coherence really helps you with making these complex structures. So really great performance. And finally, your pronunciation, your pronunciation was also very easy and clear to understand how you were pronouncing different words or, using the other pronunciation features like, the word distress, the sentences stress, and your intonation. It was not like you were speaking to me in a very flat mode. It was all, you were just playing with your voice, depending on, is it a sentence, is it a question, what kind of question is it? So you were just talking to me naturally, you know, you were not trying to try to, and it was a, it was a very good attempt. Thank you. So yes, this is all about the criteria, your fluency and coherence, vocabulary, lexexorary source, grammatical range and accuracy and pronunciation. So generally to talk about your, it's okay to talk about your overall band score. I can. Maybe to paraphrase a bit better. And you can, of course use a even wider range of vocabulary or dramatic vocabulary. You're able to do that, of course. So do you have any questions or any doubts? Maybe to paraphrase a bit better. And you can, of course use a even wider range of vocabulary or dramatic vocabulary. You're able to do that, of course. So do you have any questions or any doubts? ",

The candidate is Marco Mullah. The candidates number is 0 1 4 3 2 5 1. The examiner is merchant cheffee, the examiner number 4 4 3 5 3 3. Good afternoon. My name is would you please tell me your full name? Good afternoon, My name is marcu mula, what can I call you? You can call me Marko sure Can I see your identification please? Thank you very much Thank you Thank you're welcome so we can now get it started with the first part of the example in the first part, I will ask you some personal questions. First I'd like to ask about your hometown, what can a visitor do in your hometown? Well, we are rather small town with 350000 citizens, roundabout I think, and we have a castle that's pretty famous you can visit and otherwise we have a lot of outdoor activities, a lot of nature around and some landmarks that you can visit. So that would be very popular here. What are the common occupations of people in your hometown? Well, that varies a lot because we have a big variety of of job offers here and very different kinds of people are living here, so that really depends you can do nearly everything is it a good place for a child growing up there? Yes, I think so. We have a lot of, facilities like health care facilities and educational facilities around here, a lot of parks and kindergartens and, like places where a child can play and it is a very safe town, a low crime rate. Now let's move on to talk about concentration, what activities help you to concentrate? Yeah, well, you see, as a trainer myself, and sport really helps me. Sport activities really help me to concentrate and to focus and to let some steam off the system. And, yeah, I get my emotions in line if you want, and it's a very good, opportunity to really, truly improve your mental balance. Do you think that having a routine helps you concentrate better? Yes, in a lot of cases, a nice routine where you have, like, your, you have your, your toes in a water that, you know, helps a lot to, concentrate and to stay on topic. Is it easy or difficult for you to concentrate in the mornings? I'm not a morning person, I have to admit. And usually after a startup time, I have my best and most creative time around half an hour, an hour into the work. So I usually place my task that, demand a lot of creativity in the second hour of my work time. Now let's move on to talk about fashion, Is fashion important to you? No, not at all. I don't really care about fashion, I have to admit. Do you think it's important to be updating your clothes and hair? No, I think, just the opposite is true because, if you think about environmental resources, the clothing industry as, one of the most resource wasting industries, at the planet and, to update your clothing like every week and then never use that clothing. It's a really a big waste of resources and has a very negative environmental impact. What kinds of clothes do you like wearing? Yeah, I mostly like wearing like, leisure clothes or clothes are very practical, like as a man, you don't have a purse. You need to get all your stuff, around. And so a lot of pockets like cargo pants and stuff like that is something I prefer. Purse, thank you very much. Now we can move on to the second part of this now. So in the second part I'm going to give you a Q card and you should talk about it for 2 minutes, okay? Before that, you have one minute to think about what you're going to say and you can make some notes to help you if you wish. Do you understand? Yes, I know, perfect. So here's the Q card and here's the paper, you should describe a short journey you usually take but dislike, now here you go and here's also a pen for you to make notes, thank you very much. You're welcome. So now you have one minute to think about this stuff, you can make notes and I will let you know once your time is over, so your one minute starts now, okay? Very well. Now your 1 minute time is over and you may talk about this topic for two minutes. Your two minutes start now. Okay, you asked me about the journey that I usually take, what I really dislike, so that's an easy pick. I got tram station just, in front of my flat mall is like 50 m away. And I take the tram twice a day after I ended my work day at around, noon, I take the tram in, to reach my gym and then two hours later, I take the tram back, when I went back home and went back home. And what I really, and dislike about this is that the trams usually packed with people and sometimes, of course, not on time. As a German, that bothers me exceptionally. And, you always need to have some earphones and your music at hand, otherwise you would speak of unprotected traveling pick because you just have to have all the input from the people and like people cuffing and talking and that's can be pretty annoying. Yeah, and, but I have to, but I have a ticket here, because it's, it very cheap to use. I just pay around fortyeight euros for a monthly ticket and I can use all the buses and the tram around in, so it's very convenient, and it gets me where I need to go. But it's not the thing that I really like to do. Would you like to add more information? Yeah, I think we have a very good term, system in general in, we have the four lines and the whole city is covered with it. So, like me, living like, and maybe 2 km from the city center away, it's like four minutes into town. So, and I can reach every part of the town within, let's say, 20 to 30 minutes. So it's a very, nice infrastructure. And, for a very fair price, I think. Thank you very much. Now your time is over and we can move on to part 3. So can I have a Q card on the paper pack? Yeah, of course you can. Thank you very much. That's my question. Very bout. So in the second part, you described a short journey usually take but dislike. And now in the third part, I would like to ask you some questions related to this topic. Okay, do you think that journeys have become easier due to the use of navigation apps? Yes, a lot. I still remember the time, when I started working in sales and, visiting clients and, literally having the map on my knee in the car and driving on the outer barn and then looking at the, at the map and reaching my clients and planning the tour. So that was a lot of effort and time put into that and a lot of stressful driving. So I personally can say yes, the first navigation system, first GPS system in the car was like a blessing for me. Okay, and why do you think people usually embark on journeys in your country? Oh, Jones are famous to be tourists all along the world and, like I would say as a German, unfortunately, you, run into Germans everywhere. I remember being in Scotland in the most northern part, very secluded area, like a little, village with artists and stuff like that. And we ran into a little like a shop and we started, we were three guys talking in German and then someone answered in German said, in German, hey, where are you from? And then it turned out, was he, was from the same town as we. So you travel at the end of the world and you always meet some Germans, so traveling and experience other cultures and, having a, big emphasis on, like, spending valuable time in your off time and go about backpacking, do you think that this kind of, traveling has also become popular nowadays? Yes, especially, with younger people, it was always popular, like, after you finisheded school going, like backpacking on for like half a year or a year Australia or, Vietnam, we're very popular countries here, and I think with Covid and the pandemic lockdown or we had a search and interest in like doing like local, trips and hiking trips and backpacking, in Germany are close by and what are the most essential items to carry on a journey in your case, in a backpacking journey or in a hiking journey and what kind of journey, what any kind of journey that you would like to do? Okay. That's dependent on where I want to go. And but cut a facility I will find there. So if I have a hotel and stuff like that, I need different things than I just, on need on a hiking tour. But let's speak about, hiking because I have some experience with it. So you need a good backpack, you need, it's like a good clothing, weather resistant clothing and good shoes. So there are some essentials for like backpacking and outdoor activities, and then you need some utility items for your daily life, like working equipment. And, like we say, if you buy cheap, you buy it twice. So some, good quality matters there. Thank you very much. Great, now this is the end of the speaking test. Okay, thank you much. Yeah. Great, now this is the end of the speaking test. Okay, thank you much. Yeah. ",

I mean, in some other countries like Canada, people have the chance to see, see some other animals like goose be birds, skongs or even birds every day. So what I want to say is that if I had the chance to live in a country like Canada, I could name a number of animals right now to answer your question, however, I remember that, I went to a zoo in Africa with my system. They're back in 2018 where I saw an African wildcat. It, actually looked similar to a hu, a huge tabby cats, but it had a thicker, a tail with a very, a blonde, tip with some black stripes. I can say that it, was nothing like the other wildcass I had seen before on TV and, from what I heard, these Wildcats are fairly shy and they have been on the brink of extinction for a while, which is sad. And what happened that they was that we were allowed to feed the wildcat. So I tried to do it, but the cat approached me like I wanted to attack me, and I was terrified. So my sister told me that I should have been more careful because these animals, these Wildcats are cannot be tamed under any circumstances. So in my opinion, that was a really interesting, animal because it was different and I had never seen something like that before. So I can say that's the reason I can. I just explain about this animal. It was something extraordinary to me. And, to talk more about that, I can say that. "

What I mean is that maybe some kinds of wild animals may bite us and that can result in some injuries and infections, which in some cases, are considered as, irreparable harm to our health and, and on the other hand, in my opinion, maybe they can cause emotional problems like when we have a pet and, they die due to some reasons which can contribute to some, to a very deep sorrow and sadness.

But the, their owners, just make sure to keep all the doors and windows closed or they may escape. And, on the other hand, in the past few years, Iranians have been, have been, showing some interest to take care of some stray puppies, which I consider a really nice job. "

Remember, all our examiners are especially trained by British Council instructors, so we know how to help you. Join us now we can quickly just go to your band score and then we can look at the other situation. So all I can say is the very beginning is, wow, thank you very much. It was brilliant. That wow had a lot of meaning to it actually, because, you know, we're looking at, we're clearly looking at a 9 here because, you're, you're very much in control of not only the English language, but also all the structures and all the techniques that are required for the IELTS speaking test. So let's go through them one by one. And you can hear me out here. I mean, fluency and coherence. We'll, we'll look at that first. I mean, your linking words, they were wonderful, they're all in the correct, spots as we were looking at answering the way you were answering the questions, referring to the questions, even that you didn't know what the questions, but you made some reference towards the question, you gave the answer, and then you went on to your off topic particular with the, particularly with the discussion, side of things, which is absolutely fine as long as there's a reference towards the, the actual answer then that we, you're good to go basically, then you'll, you'll get your marks for the speed and also connecting your ideas together, which was also also fantastic. You had your ideas, you had your sub ideas. I would say you had a very, you know, great speed of the way you, you were talking, normally we would, you know, tell the candidates to speak a little bit slower, but in your case, obviously you had no problem them with being able to, produce your idea and keep your idea going. So speed didn't get in the way of anything as, as, as we could see clearly see there and, you know, your intonation, it sounded very natural again, adding to all this, fluency and coherence business, just having a general conversation and being able to express the language the best you can. And then, okay, let's look at vocabulary. Now you had a wide range of vocabulary, I could see you could just easily paraphrase at any word and have the same meaning and use different words just to connect all those, different vocabulary together And it was a wide range and you use them all in the correct places depending on the topic and depending on the question that was asked. So again, I didn't really see any difficulty or any struggle with your vocabulary. Wonderful stuff. Okay, now to, grammar and accuracy, the again, grammar, I didn't even see you have any, grammatical errors at all, actually, to be honest with you. And that's wonderful. It would be great if everyone could do that, structure again, I mean, your simple sentences, like no problem at all, complex structures, you didn't have any problem with of that and you didn't even stutter. Okay, there were a few, ums here and then maybe, just very tiny bit. And that would happen with any native speaker, any English speaker being asked a question they didn't know about. So, there will, there will always be a pauses. In fact, pauses are good in the I L speaking desk that gives you know, a few seconds to pull yourself together and, you know, give out your answer. So a great grammar and accuracy was wonderful. Pronunciation again, with a simple pronunciations and complex, harder words to pronounce. I think you were spot on and you are very clear and I don't think you would have any problem at all with that. So, you know, we're looking, we're clearly looking at a 9 here. This is, this is a typical 9, in the, in the I L speaking test. I mean, are there any, questions you'd like to ask me to regarding this? The whole situation. Pronunciation again, with a simple pronunciations and complex, harder words to pronounce.

                "output": "we should be confused with part 2 because the question that I was asked, I didn't really have much to say about it, but, what I did was going off the topic for the first, I think the first minute, I guess it took me 1 minute to talk about some other things, my own experience, and then I just came back to the main topic. So is that a problem? "

                "input": "No, no, it's not a problem at all. In fact, we encourage candidates to do that, and I was gonna make a reference to that. Actually, you spoke for a, you know, the full two minutes and I even stopped you in the middle. That's what the examiner does. They stop the candidates. So when the two minutes is up, that's fine. And going off topic like that, I mean, you gave reference to the answer straight away, so you clearly understood what the what the question was, even though you didn't have much information or maybe you couldn't talk too much about the actual topic that was asked.

It will, definitely kill off the two minutes of time. And then again, you made another reference to the actual question.

So what I want to say is that if I had the chance to live in a country like Canada, I could name a number of animals right now to answer your question, however, I remember that, I went to a zoo in Africa with my system. They're back in 2018 where I saw an African wildcat. It, actually looked similar to a hu, a huge tabby cats, but it had a thicker, a tail with a very, a blonde, tip with some black stripes. I can say that it, was nothing like the other wildcass I had seen before on TV and, from what I heard, these Wildcats are fairly shy and they have been on the brink of extinction for a while, which is sad. And what happened that they? Animals these Wildcats are cannot be tamed under any circumstances. So in my opinion, that was a really interesting, animal because it was different and I had never seen something like that before.

What I mean is that maybe some kinds of wild animals may bite us and that can result in some injuries and infections, which in some cases, are considered as, irreparable harm to our health. And, and on the other hand, in my opinion, maybe they can cause emotional problems like when we have a pet and, they die due to some reasons which can contribute to some, to a very deep sorrow and sadness.

Remember, all our examiners are especially trained by British Council instructors, so we know how to help you. Join us now. We can quickly just go to your band score, and then we can look at the other situation. So all I can say is the very beginning is, wow, thank you very much. It was brilliant. That wow had a lot of meaning to it actually, because, you know, we're looking at, we're clearly looking at a 9 here because, you're, you're very much in control of not only the English language, but also all the structures and all the techniques that are required for the IELTS speaking test. So let's go through them one by one. And you can hear me out here. I mean, fluency and coherence. We'll, we'll look at that first. I mean, your linking words, they were wonderful. They're all in the correct, spots as we were looking at answering the way you were answering the questions, referring to the questions, even that you didn't know what the questions, but you made some reference towards the question, you gave the answer, and then you went on to your off topic particular with the, particularly with the discussion, side of things, which is absolutely fine as long as there's a reference towards the, the actual answer, then that we, you're good to go basically, then you'll, you'll get your marks for the speed and also connecting your ideas together, which was also also fantastic. You had your ideas. You had your sub ideas. I would say you had a very, you know, great speed of the way you, you were talking. Normally we would, you know, tell the candidates to speak a little bit slower, but in your case, obviously you had no problem them with being able to, produce your idea and keep your idea going. So speed didn't get in the way of anything as, as, as we could see clearly see there. And, you know, your intonation, it sounded very natural. Again, adding to all this, fluency and coherence business, just having a general conversation and being able to express the language the best you can and then, okay, let's look at vocabulary. Now, you had a wide range of vocabulary. I could see you could just easily paraphrase at any word and have the same meaning and use different words just to connect all those, different vocabulary together. And it was a wide range and you use them all in the correct places depending on the topic and depending on the question that was asked. So again, I didn't really see any difficulty or any struggle with your vocabulary. Wonderful stuff. Okay, now to, grammar and accuracy, the, again, grammar, I didn't even see you have any. Of that and you didn't even stutter, okay, there were a few, ums here and then maybe, just very tiny bit. And that would happen with any native speaker, any English speaker being asked a question they didn't know about. So, there will, there will always be a pauses. In fact, pauses are good in the I L speaking desk that gives you know, a few seconds to pull yourself together and, you know, give out your answer. So a great grammar and accuracy was wonderful. Pronunciation again, with a simple pronunciations and complex, harder words to pronounce. I think you were spot on and you are very clear and I don't think you would have any problem at all with that. So, you know, we're looking, we're clearly looking at a 9 here. This is, this is a typical 9, in the, in the I L speaking test. I mean, are there any, questions you'd like to ask me to regarding this? The whole situation? Pronunciation again, with a simple pronunciations and complex, harder words to pronounce.

                "output": "We should be confused with part 2 because the question that I was asked, I didn't really have much to say about it, but, what I did was going off the topic for the first, I think the first minute, I guess it took me 1 minute to talk about some other things, my own experience.

So when the two minutes is up, that's fine. And going off topic like that, I mean, you gave reference to the answer straight away. So you clearly understood what the what the question was, even though you didn't have much information or maybe you couldn't talk too much about the actual topic that was asked. So we actually encourage candidates to do that. And, you did that perfectly. You made the 30% reference towards the actual topic and then you went off topic and it's absolutely fine to do that. That's not a problem. In fact, that that's a technique that, you know, we would o always in encourage for I'll I'll candidates to do that, because it will save you. It will, definitely kill off the two minutes of time. And then again, you made another reference to the actual question. So that just that proves to the examiner that you've understood the question, even though you don't have much information about it.

And basically it applies to families on the stage when they have a live audience. So these two groups, these two families, basically, they would have to get into games and do different activities and then they'll be scored at the very end and always found that very interesting because they get put in situations where they wouldn't know how to, for example, make pottery or how to act on the stage. Depends what the activity is. We've always watched this program, we found out about it from ITV though advertising, ITV is our channel 3 in the UK and we just love to sit around the television and watch that together as a family, we find it most fun, so I enjoy the activities that they do. Like I said, they get onto the stage, I have to do an acting game or they'll be maybe making a painting to see who could perform the painting better, than the other and I always like the way the presenter hosts the show, he's always very energetic and the way he addresses the candidates and then where he talks to the audience, it's always very theatrical and very friendly at the same time. And then in between he goes on about joking and, trying to encourage other people to get up on the stage and get involved and sometimes even picks some people in the audience. So it, it's a very, very fun show to watch. Another shard like to talk about is, sylla blacks blind date. And that's where she brings people onto action match, make people single people, of course. And then if they pick the hidden candidate and they like what the other person is saying, then they'll choose that person to maybe go on holiday. That's, that's the thing they'll, they'll go on the trip and then they'll come back next week. "

So I think it's very, very important they have the governmental, chat channels. They also have lots of private channels and lots of people, plenty of people like to watch these channels. You can watch anything you want, You can view movies, TV series, soap operas. But nowadays, obviously, because of the internet and technology, people prefer to watch the same shows that, our televisions are showing on their phones, maybe laptops, maybe Netflix.

Not only do a lot of people learn something, it could be a language related show where they're, there's something we have called catch phrase. And many people love to watch that and improve their vocation abulary. But there's plenty of entertainment on, on our TV, channels that many people like to look at. "

We would sit in front of the television as a family and watch too many shows. Many people like to do things individually, especially with the technology accessible, like we have our laptops, we have, tablets and just walking around with our phones and being connected to the internet.

Your use of vocabulary is very wide. It's going to be a great variety and I would definitely say that you're a, you're a band knight because you're taking all the boxes that the examiners want in this speaking desk.

I think because you were thinking about your story, you were not looking for, a new choice of words or any idioms, which you were very, you were using naturally in some of your answers. You use them exactly where they were supposed to be used. You weren't using too much of them because we get this a lot. Especially over here, we have a lot of examiners saying, the more idioms you use, the better that's gonna gain you points that that's, that's not the case at all, but the examiner doesn't, doesn't want to see someone talking more complicated. They want to see that you're natural. That's why we call it a coherence coerances is, is your, is your natural way of speaking to be something close to a nature speaker being, being fluent and your pronunciations are all absolutely perfect 100% spot on.

Just elaborate on it more. That's all you have to do. I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say go after more vocabulary. I wouldn't say a work on your ground because they're all spot on, they're all perfect and you're, you're very articulate, you're very completely crisp, understandable and is there any questions you'd like to ask.

Your, your use of vocabulary was very impressive cause that that's obviously going to be examined too.

On that year, I had to sacrifice everything and give up on all the joys and to somehow step out of, of my comfort zone. Despite all of this, I managed to keep a high spirit because I knew that this would end very quickly and on top of all that, this would mark a significant milestone on that year. So I burned the midnight oil for months on end, and after a couple of months, when I wrapped my certificate in hand, it was, I was like over the moon. And I could, I get the feeling that all the sufferings have come to an end and, it was like the time to open a new page of my life. And for this reason, my parents were so proud of me to throw a graduation party for me and to move on more to the details. I can say that this party was only a dinner party. We, which only included my own family and some of my friends, my parents invited a musical band to perform my favorite songs, and we all had a blast together on that night. And at the end, everyone congratulated me and wished me a successful college year ahead. And I was really proud of myself on that night, which marked an indelible moment for me that I will treasure forever, I think. And, I am really looking forward for the college life in the future. "

Your your use of grammar is very much like a native speaker, the way you use it and your vocabulary, your vocabulary is absolutely that is spot onto. I like the way you, use it. Your use of vocabulary is very wide. It's going to be a great variety and I would definitely say that you're a, you're a band knight because you're taking all the boxes that the examiners want in this speaking desk. I mean, when you have these, you had a few pauses in between, but that's what a native speaker would do. They would, they would pause in between and, obviously move on to the rest of their story. I think because you were thinking about your story, you were not looking for, a new choice of words or any idioms, which you were very, you were using naturally in some of your answers. You use them exactly where they were supposed to be used. You weren't using too much of them because we get this a lot. Especially over here, we have a lot of examiners saying, the more idioms you use, the better that's gonna gain you points that that's, that's not the case at all. But the examiner doesn't, doesn't want to see someone talking more complicated. They want to see that you're natural. That's why we call it a coherence coerances is, is your, is your natural way of speaking to be something close to a nature speaker being, being fluent and your pronunciations are all absolutely perfect 100% spot on. So you really don't have any trouble, gaining this, this bad night. You are naturally a bad night. And do you speaking loud loudly, that obviously helps, helps a lot. And if if I was good tell you to be any better than you are now, make any improvements for this test, I would say just speak slightly slower to, just, you know, just to keep eye of the time or think about the time because, obviously you have two minutes to speak in the, in part 2 and part 3, the, there are questions, but if you answer these questions too fast, then you're gonna obviously limit yourself and it is just better maybe to stick to the first three answers and think, what are you going to say more? Just elaborate on it more. That's all you have to do. I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say go after more vocabulary. I wouldn't say a work on your ground because they're all spot on, they're all perfect and you're, you're very articulate, you're very completely crisp, understandable and is there any questions you'd like to ask.

Your, your use of vocabulary was very impressive cause that that's obviously going to be examined too. And when you have this, wide range of, vocabulary, you're going to, have less selfrepetition, which you absolutely did not have. I mean, if you were repeat, trying to repeat yours, you're trying to fix your sentence because that happens. This is not a news bullet. We're, we're having, a normal conversation here.

Idioms are a type of idiomatic language, phrasal verbs or a type of idiomatic language, slang, colloquialisms, local language books until you'll hear around here, that's another, it's just natural English, there's a difference between textbook English, it's like standard English and then English that you'll hear out on the street, it's VI, 2 very different things.

I paid ￡25000 to be here. That does not include the plane ticket, but yes to till they that would be the most expensive thing. I, where I bought it. Well, I live in India, so, I came here at Queens and I came here in the UK to study at Queens. Education has become really expensive, but I think this is by far the most expensive ever. But it was worth it because I learned a lot. They have really good infrastructure and the quality of the teaching stuff is really good. I met a students from all over the world here, so the cultural exchange was really good. I learned a lot, not just from being in the classroom, but from outside of the classroom as well and just talking to people on the streets or volunteering. It gave me a lot of experience, which I don't think I could have gotten just being in a classroom. So I did pay for education here to study marketing and Ana analytics, but I came out learning a lot more than just that. Why I bought it because, I really wanted to study analytics, like I mentioned before, but, besides that, queens is a really good brand and it has a really good image in India and I think all over the world, it's in the Russells group.

So you know, there's a try and to try and next time you could work on your collocations a little bit on, on, your range of, of especially descriptive adjectives. A good way to think about it is instead of saying really something, you know, there's the, instead of saying really good, amazing, or, or it's like, like this, this Meline meeting is really nice. It's delicious though. That lady over there is really good looking, beautiful. So there's often one higher level adjective to use instead of really plus a simpler adjective. That's that would be a way that you could, improve your vocabulary a little bit. But also remember you're being judged on, the, your whole performance. You're not being judged on what many students are probably writing in the comments right now is she said good three times. Like that is not how the examiner is judging you. The examiner is not is judging your whole use of vocabulary, not that you use the word good three times in one or two sentences. The examiner would listen to the rest of your vocabulary and it's not like negative marking. But just I think you, as I said before, I think that your vocabulary is far wider ranging than you are showing in the test. Because when I look at your writing, your, your, your vocabulary is much more wide ranging. It's always accurate. So I think you can take AAA chat, and I also think it's some higher level users of English are used to just saying really good. And the teachers are good and they, because that's how normal people speak most of the time. But because we're in a test and we wanna get as high a mark as possible, you would want to take, some chances. The only time I would change that advice would be if you were slightly lower level and you were, say, at a 6.5 and you needed a 7. I wouldn't tell someone at that level to take more chances with vocabulary because that would probably lower their score because they would make so many mistakes. But because your accuracy is so high, I think that you could vary it a little bit more and your grammar was excellent. I probably already mentioned that, pronunciation was good. There were some words like you're saying, materialistic, and you said it very, very quickly and kind of under inside your mouth. So that's what, so what might have been, I understood exactly what you meant, but, someone on the, watching on the video might have been like, I didn't quite understand that. So try and enunciate as much as you can. But you don't have a problem with, with, with your pronunciation at all. So just a little, again, a little tune tuning rather than a criticism.

So I think overall your score is probably going to be about a about a 5.0. Okay, possibly now as the speaking exam is subjective, possibly could go up a little bit, okay, But I'd say if, if I were to give you one score and I would be a 5.0, a lot of good point points, a lot of positives, okay, you're very fluent in your answers, the hesitation was very minimal. Okay, so that's a really good point with your answers. They were also very logical, very easy to understand. Okay, so communication was not really an issue when we were talking, so that's really good. Main issue, I think is with the grammar there was to too many errors that might just pull you down a bit, just with little bit, with tense and a little bit with preposition, preposition with two and 4 articles with, the, and a, for example, in front of place names, you know, the soul, you know, the career a little bit was coming in. So, and just a little bit with, the correct tense, you know, if you're talking in the, you know, present continuous past continuous, it was a little bit of mix up there. So I think the grammar would need to be a little tighter, a little tighter. So I think, you know, because you're speaking quite fluently and quite fast, maybe the grammar is suffering because of that, you know, So I think sometimes students, if you need to slow it down a little just to tighten the grammar a little bit, can be good. I think it's important to find the balance between the two of them. Yeah, between the two of them. Yeah, in terms of like vocabulary was quite wide, you know, it was quite good. Some like little bits were, there's a bit of confusion between a couple of words, for example, you talked about traffic in your hometown. So I think you wanted to say that transportation. Yeah, so traffic is kind of negative, but many forms of transportation is more positive. When you talked about your hometown, he says cozy, I probably cozy would be more for like inside a room or the atmosphere. I wouldn't use it for a hometown. Yeah, so a couple of little bits there. Moving on to pronunciation, there was just a few words as well. I think the L and the R were a little, little, little bit tricky sometimes, you know, when you're talking about, like prefer and place and lot, there was a little bit of confusion between them, but overall not too bad. Just as well with the, there's a, the word photographer. Okay, so I know it's spelled photographer, but the pronunciation is photographer. Photographer, there's like different stress in the word. So if you wanna just look up the word stress there. So, yeah, there's few, few issues there to correct. And I would say try and focus on on the grammar and just bit tighter with it. And then you can definitely get up to, you know, up to higher scores. Yeah, I think it was good overall, good overall. So thank you. So thank you. ",

Pronunciation was nice and clear and there wasn't a lot of hesitation, but there was a lot of grammar errors. That's what, that's what will bring your score down a bit today. I think some of your answers were have overly complicated. Try to speak like a little bit simply, simply, some of the answers were not so clear as well. You know, I think maybe when you started to speak, you kind of got off the topic of the question a little bit. Try and focus on the question a little bit. In terms of grammar is a few things I'll point out. What do you see? He said one time next year January, we don't need to say here, they're just next January. Yeah, I asked you, what do you like to do, like your hobbies? He said, I would like to so that's the same as I want to, so it should be just, I like to I like to do that. I see that one question as well. I asked, do you like taking photos and you said no, you feel shy, you don't feel good, but taking photos means like you actually with the camera, it doesn't mean, yeah, it doesn't mean you in the photo. So it used to be like, yeah, like taking photos of nature, of people. Yeah, things like that. Sometimes we were using like the present continuous tense when we should use a present simple. For example, you said most people are using like public transportation should be. Most people use public transportation for Ro routine activities. In terms of some prepositions here, visit to anjong was it? Yeah, so I just with visit, there's no preposition visit. Yeah, and when I visit there, you said my grandma's, you're talking about two grandmothers were you? No, I want one. Okay, so just make sure it's singular. So I was hearing my grandma's were, so my grandma was my grandmother was, so in general, it's just the grammar errors, I can point more out to you after, but as I would say, try to just speak a little bit more simply and more to the point of the topic. These are the, these are the things I think that would help you improve a little bit. Some of the answers were a little bit confusing to listen to, Yeah, but yeah, there's some good points, you know, pronunciation is very clear, very nice. Also, your fluency were quite comfortable when you spoke. I'll just focus on the grammars. I'll give you the sheet after, of course the camera is here, so you're, you know, it's different, right?

I mean, you're quite quick to answer the questions. It didn't pause too much or anything like that. And you answered the questions like to a decent level of detail. I guess in the part two, you kind of struggled to like talk for the full 10, 2 minutes. So like towards the end, it kind of felt like you were kind of, repeating yourself and you kind of came to a little bit of a stop. So that would be the main thing. See editor on the part. You remember just kind of talk if I can tell the examiner, chan, see the stop. Alright, vocabulary. Yeah, not bad. Like there wasn't any like too many obvious mistakes, like any misuses of vocabulary. Some of the phrasing could have been just a bit more accurate. So for instance, he said, okay, so when you were talking about living in soy, said there are many options to hang out with. You better to say something like there are many places where I can hang out with my friends. You said as Chinese increase, I guess what you mean to say is like, as my Chinese improves, so as my Chinese . Alright, vocabulary. Yeah, not bad.

And you said Li listening is the basic skill. So I know what you mean. Probably just a slightly more accurate thing would be like listening is like the fundamental skill or listening is the like the foundational skill, So I mean, book, I mean, not too bad on the whole. There wasn't really any expressions which would really like impress your examiner, you know I'm. Alright, pronunciation. Yeah, pretty good on the whole. Wasn't too many issues with pronunciation. There was just one little things. So when you said globalized, yeah, you're like globalized it. So yeah, you want to kind of avoid those kind of sounds. That's kind of after sounds globalized. But other than that, their pronunciation was already actually just going back to the vocabulary. It was a little bit of repetition of certain words. So you wanna kind of use a nice range of vocabulary. So for instance, in your part 2, you just repeated the word Chinese a couple of times, quite close to each other I. So, yeah, I mean, you can always just use a pronoun. You can say it rather than just repeating the same word. Yeah, actually in that case, you could probably say like Mandarin or something like that. See? Yeah, there's a little bit of repetition. Alright grandma. So yeah, grandma would probably be the biggest, the biggest area you need to work on. So lots of little mistakes, really. There's a few kind of recurring error is, So you said in there a couple of letter you so you corrected yourself. You said there are many cars in there. So you don't need to say in before a pronoun. You don't even really say it when you're naming, you don't use a preposition when you're naming a place. So yeah, you would just say there are many cars there. If you were naming a place, you might say there are many cars in soul. But yeah, not, not if you're just using the pronoun. Another one. There's a few times you used. Well, you said ink, you kind of included a guarant when you didn't need to. So yeah, if you're just talking about like regular routine things, you can just use like the base stem of a verb, So for instance, you said my dad is working in software. So it would be better just to say my dad works in software. Yeah, my daddy's working. It sounds like you're kind of talking about like right now at this moment. So yes, quite a common comment, see? And there was another one you said, so I asked you like what advice you would give to someone who was just beginning to learn a language. And you said, I would tell them listening a lot. So in that, in that instance, you say, I would tell them, listen a lot. It sounds like you're kind of talking about like right now at this moment. So yes, quite a common comment, see?

Alright, sorry, I want to work at mobile applications. So probably I want to work on mobile applications or maybe I work with mobile applications would be better. So yeah, you would just say at when you're talking about like the location or something. And yeah, so when you were talking about like learning languages, and you're talking about like the advice you would give, you said, listen, radio. So I'd be like to say, listen to the radio. When there was, there was another one is so another state, which is just, I pronouns. So he said they were just missing from sentences. So I asked you about whether you think most people enjoy studying English. And you said many people don't enjoy that much. So better to say many people don't enjoy it that much.

We've come across with that. So yeah, the speaking test is marked in four categories, so fluency, vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar. Okay, the candidate answered the questions quite alright, but the one issue, especially in part 1, his answers were very short. There was not a lot of detail. So on the IELTS test, it's important to remember that you're the candidate and you have to produce. So if your answers are very short, you're not producing your English and therefore the examiner cannot give you the marks. So that was a little bit of an issue in the first part. Okay, I'm moving on to vocabulary is one instance where we could do it a bit of improving. There was a lot of quite simplistic vocabulary. There was repetition of good big and like so's it's not a problem, but if you're looking for a higher score, you really need to vary your vocabulary, you need to try and get some higher level, into your answers, Okay, in terms of pronunciation, it wasn't too bad. There was a few instances with R and L rent and length and it was kind of an issue there, but not too bad. I'm moving on in this grammar. I think a lot of the time the sentences were not full sentences sometimes there was one word and two word. So as I said earlier, there wasn't a lot of detail and that showed in the grammar. And when he started to use more complex sentences, there was a bit of trouble. Okay, so that's gonna prevent them from moving up to the six band to achieve a 6.0, you do need to be a bit more accurate with grammar. There's prepositions, there was tense issues, hold them down. Okay, yeah, but overall it wasn't too bad, but I think with a bit more, think a bit more like knowledge of the test and knowledge of what he had to do, whereas which was like answer in a more detailed way, and I think you could really improve just by knowing a few bits about the test.

Okay, so the speaking test is marked in four categories. There's fluency, vocabulary, like scullability and grammar. Okay, so for the 6.0, fluency level has to be quite high, but some instances of hesitation are okay for this level. And as the students showed when he started speaking, it was quite good. But maybe at the beginning of the question, there was some moments of hesitation. So that's gonna affect that part of the fluency score, although overall not bad for that level. Same way when you get to the pronunciation, generally it was okay. There was a couple of words like with E D, for example, stopped was stop it and re relatives was pronounced a little bit awkwardly as well. So there's just a few words that were not correct, but in general's pronunciation was quite accurate. Okay, when it comes to the grammar, the big thing that the student was missing was prepositions, okay? There was a lot of instances, for example, or would be one like go restaurant or went Spanish island or go to a restaurant, went to a Spanish island. So he's missing some prepositions and some articles. That was kind of a pattern throughout the test. Okay, so that's something that this is to work on if you wanna go up from 6.0 to 6.5, you really need to like tighten off these grammars. Okay, so for a 6.0, it can be got, but any higher needs to be a bit more accurate. In terms of vocabulary, yeah, mostly accurate as well. Some instances, maybe there was like C and watch, there was a, the confusion on the words, and there was a bit of repetition, but more simple vocabulary. So again, to move up, we need natural phrases and expressions. But, overall, I think it was a pretty good test, but there's definitely room to improve. I think the key points is the prepositions and the tense. That's what really needs to improve to you. Hope 1111. In terms of vocabulary, yeah, mostly accurate as well.

I think that's the most important thing because, oh, let's say I'm studying or I have a job. Commuting is the most important thing for me, I guess. So maybe near bus station or subway station would be nice. And I think for my home, it should be first cozy and should be secondly, should be equipped with lots of furnitures and. Other facilities and I would say its better if there's like a gym or swimming pool at the apartment for public use. And, for this home, I would say it doesn't have to be big because I would live there for my 20s. But after once I marry or get a kid, maybe I would move to a bigger apartment.

I would say it's very convenient for everything since everything is prepared already. But I would say it's very packed. And sometimes you wanna be by yourself, by yourself, but there's a lot, there are a lot of people around you. So I think it's hard for you to get like personal zone, but for countryside, I think that's very easy. Like you want to be alone and you want some of your private time.

But for younger generation, they can drive and they have enough money to afford effort up. I mean, purchase are their own transport.

And I was thinking, living in Australia I've seen two story subway, so maybe I thought, so, so government or city hall could think about making two storey subway or a bit longer subways in order to put in more people inside. I, but other than that, I think it's quite well organized. "
            },
            {
                "input": "Yeah, good idea. Alright, yeah, so let's get into the feedback now. Yeah, so it's good test you did well, you're nice and confident you spoke fluently. Yeah I'd say your score would be about 6.5. I would say what you would get now to get up to 7.0. I think the only thing that's really kind of stopping you probably is just some small grammars kind of throughout you know? So in terms of your fluency, it was really good. There was very little hesitation throughout, you were able to speak comfortably and you answered all the questions on the spot. Really good, really good, as was your pronunciation, very clear, very accurate. There were no real issues to point out there. So yeah, fluency, pronunciation, really good, quite good, possibly like above 7. Obviously there's a few vocabulary issues, let's just point out a couple just to give some examples, you were talking about your name. Yeah. And you said there were a few other candidates for your name, like candidates suggested, suggest to me like people like presidential candidate would be a different person, but if you're talking about a name, I would say options, there were a few other options, but you chose minsok okay, good, use the word as well, disgusting for the genes, I probably wouldn't use that word for disgusting signs, just a little bit worse, a little bit extreme in that sense. For example, when you're talking about food, like really bad food, you would say disgusting or something that would make your stomach feel bad. Yeah, so yeah, maybe for that one. Yeah, the word just the word furniture is on accountable. So you would never say furnitures, just furniture. Furniture, yeah, so you can say a piece of furniture, Yeah, okay, yeah, really good. Just little, little, bit of word work between packed and crowded. They're very similar actually, you know, but if I were talking about a city, I would say crowded rather than packed. Packed suggests like you're in a room, you know, if you're talking about the subway or you're talking about a, you know, establishment, you could say it's repacked because everyone's inside. Yeah. So there's a few, few, few, few little things with vocabulary either, in terms of grammar, yeah, the tense is usually alright, but I think what let you down is just some prepositions, just prepositions are kind of missing from a lot of your sentences. For example, you said go to gym, go to the gym, go to the cinema. You said degu is at the southern part, so you say in the southern part of Korea, in the southern part, when we're talking about jeans, okay, so just the subject you were using was it, it's very comfortable, it's very popular. What should it be? They, yeah, exactly, cause they're, I know they're one thing, but they're plural, you know? Yeah, so they're very popular, they're very comfortable, yeah, and you said you bought two, very light blue jeans. Yes, what should it be two pairs? Yeah, exactly, yeah, it's hard on the spot. Yeah, two pairs of light blue jeans. Yeah, two pairs of yeah, indeed. The second part, yeah, part 2 was quite strong. You spoke for a full two minutes, small bits I think you were saying, it should be, it should be, but since it's your, your dream home and like if you see in the question there, it says like, wood, wood. So I would stick the wood in the part too because it's your like imagination, it would be huge, it would be in Seoul, it would be here, not, not too much else there one time you said most of people should be just most people. The second part, yeah, part 2 was quite strong. You spoke for a full two minutes, small bits I think you were saying, it should be, it should be, but since it's your, your dream home and like if you see in the question there, it says like, wood, wood. So I would stick the wood in the part too because it's your like imagination, it would be huge, it would be in Seoul, it would be here, not, not too much else there one time you said most of people should be just most people.

One question I started with, do you think blah, blah, blah? Yeah, and you answered with, yeah, I agree. So you can only say I agree if the question is, do you agree? So just a little, little thing to be careful of there. But yeah, I think it was really good test, just small grammars. I'll give you this after and you can have a look at it. You know, I have more detailed thing here. So yeah, if you tidy that up would be a bit better. Yeah, okay, alright, thank you very much, thank you, thank you. ",

Your fluency is pretty good, but and you use, but there are some limitations on your ability to, use more kind of dynamic or flexible use of the grammar structure. So as you, you know, continue your studies, you might think about, how to use the grammar structure more flexibly or, you know, adopt, I mean, in your mind, adopt some different, some new, some fresh structures to, that will allow you to have more complex conversations. Yeah, and then, there was so that, that think about the structure of your language and maybe adopt some new grammar structures. There was some hesitancy. So in terms of fluency, we look for two kinds of hesitancy, one is about the content and the other is about the language, okay? So, a native speaker doesn't think too much about the language. They might pause and think about the content. But, you know, for a nonnative speaker, there's, if the little bit lower structure is to stop and hesitate around the language, okay? And so sometimes that was a little, a bit evident in your speech. And then other times when you were speaking about something a little bit, you were speaking better or a little bit stronger about a topic, then you would hit some hesitancy around the content and that that's actually okay. I mean, native speakers, have trouble with content sometimes too when they think about, you know, what they're saying, but the language part you need to maybe work on and, to really score higher in Ielts, you need you, it's okay to pause on content, but it's less, it's a lower grade if you pause on language, okay? And then in terms of fluid, well, in terms of fluency, that goes with coherence. So being like understandable, yeah, and some of that language is, you know, the overall structure. We use a lot of markers. We call, you know, connectives and some linking language and stuff. So you might, think a little bit or try to learn some new connective language to help you create a better structure for your language. So you do use connectives, which is a good thing. But some of them repeat. So like, you know, at this time or, you know, some simple ones. Anyway, you're using a sort of common set of connectives. So you might try to think about adopting new language that will allow you to, maybe contrast ideas or, you know, set up comparison and some connective language around that, okay? But yes, so you said things like obviously, which is a marker, at this time, which is for, you know, the, the structure in terms of time chronologically. Okay, and those are all good. Another grammar, function is, when we, are moving on to some grammar functions, colocation, sorry, you know, many words go in pairs. So for example, I had a haircut. So had an haircut, not did a haircut. Right? So the pairs have an haircut. Yeah, those are called colocation when we have words that always go together like that. So anyway, so some Fri, you think about the colocation and make sure your verbs, you have agreement with the verbs and the, and the other words that go with it. And then, some of the phrases too. So like you said, suggest us, but actually they would suggest to us, you know, and some of that kind of phraseology, make sure that it's a little, a little stronger. Another grammar, function is, when we, are moving on to some grammar functions, colocation, sorry, you know, many words go in pairs. So for example, I had a haircut.

I think the student produced a quite high level of fluency throughout some instances of hesitation in possibly part 3. But I think it's normal that there's a some thinking time because everyone is like that. Everyone needs time to think about their answers on occasion. So I think for fluency level was quite high. I'm moving on to the grammar point as well. Grammar throughout was pretty high. Again, there was some instances of like mistakes with possibly like prepositions. Some prepositions were dropped like a specialized in or go to. So there's a few instances of that. But overall, there was a quite a good range and, quite accurate for the most part. Going on to pronunciation. Then yeah, there were a few words that were not quite perfect, but generally everything was easy to understand for a 7.0. It doesn't have to be completely perfect. There can be some instances of words with little odd pronunciation, but that's fine again, and yeah, going on to lexiculability the vocabulary, quite a good range. At the same time, there's some like nice words, like charismatic and you know, even some like kind of collocations. These is I'm a foodie, things like that. So these are good as well in the test using some modern words that are quite popular at the moment. So, yeah, I think overall it's a good test. And yeah, deservedly 7.0. Going on to pronunciation.

No, but not, not even the teachers complained about that. They understood that, oh, okay, high school students, they don't sleep that much. Okay, Just leave them away, okay?

Even though they lack of sleeping time, they should, take care of their studies and they need, they need to take care of their, time for sleeping.

Yeah, 7.5 around that now it I could possibly fall a little bit lowered, you know, examiners are a little bit, you know, depending on the day, you know, so I would say put it at about a 7.5. Yeah, thank you. So yeah, the, the way it works, the way the exam works is graded on four parts. Yeah, so fluency, pronunciation, grammar and lexical resource your vocabulary. Okay, so yeah, if we just pick apart like 1 by one, if we look at it, we look at your fluency for a start. Yeah, I think it's really high level. Obviously there's some little bits of hesitation, you know, at the beginning, especially being on camera, I think everyone is the same, but in general, once you start speaking, there's very little hesitation. So that's really strong and we jump the pronunciation as well. No issues there at all. Sounds very natural. Yeah, really good. Yeah, we look at, grammar now when phrasing grammar kind of vocabulary comes hand in hand. So in part 1, few things you said there, the words were a little, little bit awkward. For example, one time I've I've maintained this hairstyle maintain sounds a bit formal for the aisle speaking test. I would just say I've had this hairstyle. Yeah, just simple is good. Sometimes even though the word looks a little bit fancier when you say maintain, but I think simple and natural is better in that situation. Here. Just a couple of, a couple of verb changes there. You said taking a job and take my haircut. We'd always say get a job, get my haircut. Okay, take and get. I think it's some European learners. Do you have like, a mixture between these two? Yeah, and yeah I'm just there's 1 1 pluralization there between like hair, hair and hairs. Okay, so you would always say it's funny because when you say when you talk about your hair in general, you say hair. But if you wanna talk about 1 or two or three, you say hairs. You said taking a job and take my haircut. We'd always say get a job, get my haircut. Okay, take and get. I think it's some European learners. Do you have like, a mixture between these two?

I would probably say like stay up all night, stay up all night or even like pulling all night or maybe something like that. Just, you know, to increase the lexical resource a little bit. That'll be really good. So for a student of your level, which is really high to, you know, to increase and get better scores, what you would need to focus on is just expressions like that. You know, you wanna say I had to pull it all nighter for my uni exams, you know? So yeah, blah, blah, blah. That was pretty good. Another pluralization 1 was like my works, my works, I would say maybe like my tasks is better or my work without the plural, okay, yeah, and one time as well when I think I ask you a question, do people who get up early are more productive than people who get up later? When you answered, you said, yeah, I believe that people who get up early are more deductible, overruled. So in the test as well, we don't need to repeat the question. I think, you know, so we just say, yeah, I think so, or yeah, you know, something like that. Okay, good, good. So I think like overall, like what a student of your level should probably work on is just and try and get more like more like idioms, more natural expressions, you know, So, in terms of grammar, the mistakes are very minor, you know, so everyone's gonna make a mistake when you're doing the test for like 15 minutes, you know, and everyone, people are nervous, but yeah, so definitely a student to your level, try and like up your lexical resource and that would make sure to get a higher score.

                "output": "so, okay. I'll start by answering to the question of a good decision that I made and what is it? So the, this decision I made was to about the challenge that actually I challenge myself to read books, like three books in a month. And when I started it, I think I have to say that it was the end of my semester, and that was November. The reason why I decided to, read three books in a month was because I serve a psychiatrist and I was in the early stages of the panic disorder. And, you know, if I do not recover from it, that will have a disastrous, like the consequence in the future. Therefore, the psychiatrist decided me need to do something that I really like. So I love studying and I love reading. Therefore I decided to read books and challenge myself. And the result of it was quite astonishing. So far I have finisheded like six books cause, I started it November and it's already like two months and a half. So, and also I was able to, get a lot of informations and, the things that I actually didn't know. And also it made me much happier. And now I feel that my time isn't wasted and I don't feel pressured or like, stressed out as I used to be. And I think that reading books is also important for people cause it always helps them to learn and get something useful. And it's never waste of time or something. So, that's the reason why I think I'm gonna continue doing these, challenge for myself. And I think that rather than watching movies that I used to do and it made me stress out cause I usually like look at the people and I feel like I'm just a like loser or something. But reading the books I'm finding out that there are like people who are having the same problems with me, but still like trying to move on. "

So yes, that's why we limit with ourselves. And some people do not want to go over their comfort zones. Cause sometimes making decisions means that you have to go over your expectations and everything. So that's the reasons why they do not want to like or find it difficult to make decisions overall. "

But when it comes to the decisions of like about the science or like medicine, you have to discuss asset with others as well cause it's like a global decision.

Like for example, I wanted to go to another country, but my parents rejected this idea saying that, the South Korea is the safest country to go for. And I was like really stressed out and upset. But yeah, that was actually my decision in my life, That's what I thought. But yeah, as you can see, it's the safest, like considering the covidnineteen in other cases. "

So I feel like to the, to answer known to this question cause, sometimes they want some using just for their own desire and they don't know about the consequences. Therefore, like parents knowing everything, they can help and they can guide them. They actually in the age that they need a hand to hold and a voice to guide. So therefore, I think that children are not still able to make decisions on their own. Yeah, so like the parents and teacher or the people who are responsible for them are the ones who must be, who must help them to make a decision or something. "

Parents reject their children who are interested or talented in art just because they think that it's not a good way of earning money in the future. Therefore it's gonna stress out the kids and I saw like I read books and I saw my friends who were like pressured by their parents having like losing both their talents and interest in life. So I think like the role of the parents is just to help and guide. It's not like they should not like force their kids to follow their decision. So, so. "

So like, for example, I wanted to go to another country, but because of the covidnineteen, I can't, and it's not out of my, like, it, it isn't something that I can control, it's out of my control, therefore, the weather and some kind of like political or the social like problems such as like, some kind of wars between countries that they can affect this and the, another reason why people change their decision can be like financial situation of theirs and sudden an unexpected, like, like incidents and these kind of things.

There's 4 things we're graded on. As you know, we're graded on fluency, vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar. Okay, so if we look at each one individually, fluency was very strong, it was barely any hesitations, I was really good, wide range of vocabulary, pronunciation, no issues at all. These three very strong. Also grammar, not not much to talk about, but there are small errors that we can look at, you know, when you're speaking in front of a camera and doing a test is hard, there's going to be smaller. I'm sure you know these errors as well, but I'll just point them out here anyway. Talking about hobbies, you said one of the hobbies, obviously, one, it's yours. You should say one of my hobbies, my hobbies, one time he said watching Tvs, so watching TV or watching TV shows is fine. Yeah, watching TV programs, when we say transportation, transportation is uncountable, so we can say different transportations, we should say different kinds of transportation or different, methods of transportation. Other one you said, by people they always worried about. So make sure always goes with present tense. So they always worry about this. These are small errors here, nothing much stressed out, stressed out on weekends. I think, you know the meaning of stressed out, don't you? Yeah, I think it was just a slip of the tongue here, but it's okay. Other ones, when you're talking about part 2, you said your doctor decided me to do something. So I would say instead I decided I'd probably say recommended. Yeah, recommended me, Yeah, reading the book, same, he said the same problem, same problem with me preposition for same as always as same as always like that. So it's similar you'd say similar to same always same as, and one time you said introvert person, so introvert is the noun, so you should say introverted person for the adjective. Yeah, small things there. In part 3 you mentioned comfort zone, you said, like over their comfort zone instead of over you should say out of, out of their comfort zone. Yeah, smaller things you said because of the covidnineteen usually we don't say the article for you say just be because of Covid because of her own. Yeah, it's an article for that. So as you can see, the grammars are very small, there's not much, there's just a few things that will add up that will bring your score down a small bit.

It's very quiet. Not a lot of, I'd say noise noises. The greatest part of my neighborhood is that you can find pretty much everything. Like every other block.

Another change was that we used to have like a huge department store, but now it's like a, it's like a wedding convention. So that's one downside.

And our commander decided to not let to ban the soldiers from going on leave since in an occasion where there's a like a weather or like a or like a disaster forecasted, we're not allowed to leave base because we have to maintain a certain amount of force, so on. All the all the soldiers were devastated, including me, because all we wait about and all we care about is vacations, to be honest with you. And so I was supposed to leave on Monday, but I was banned to leave and we were either going to be let go the day after, depending on how the weather goes. And on Monday, all my mates at the base, all we could possibly do was just desperately pray for the weather to get better and for our commander to make the optimal decision.

And, as of now, the coronavirus is on the main issue, but usually during this time of the year, the weather forecast always talks about how bad the micro dust is. And I think that definitely affects, people's daily lives because around this time of the year, especially like during spring, people would like to go out to the park and have a picnic with their families. And that's, it's always after winter. So people are so wanting, so desiring to go out and have some time with their beloved ones, right?

And, as of now, the coronavirus is on the main issue, but usually during this time of the year, the weather forecast always talks about how bad the micro dust is.

And that's, it's always after winter. So people are so wanting, so desiring to go out and have some time with their beloved ones, right?

And that's, it's always after winter. So people are so wanting, so desiring to go out and have some time with their beloved ones, right?
